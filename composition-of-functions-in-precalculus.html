We do all this<br>by performing the operations with the function outputs, defining the<br>result as the output of our new function.<br><br>Suppose we need to add two columns of numbers that represent a husband and<br>wife's separate annual incomes over a period of years, with the result being<br>their total household income. We want to do this for every year, adding only<br>that year's incomes and then collecting all the data in a new column. If w(y)<br>is the wife's income and h(y) is the husband's income in year y, and we want T<br>to represent the total income, then we can define a new function.<br>\(T(y)=h(y)+w(y)\)<br>If this holds true for every year, then we can focus on the relation between<br>the functions without reference to a year and write:<br>\(T=h+w\)<br>Just as for this sum of two functions, we can define difference, product, and<br>ratio functions for any pair of functions that have the same kind of inputs<br>(not necessarily numbers) and also the same kinds of outputs (which do have to<br>be numbers so that the usual operations of algebra can apply to them, and which<br>also must have the same units or no units when we add and subtract). In this<br>way, we can think of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing functions.<br><br>For two functions f(x) and g(x) with real number outputs, we define new<br>functions f+g, f-g, fg, and f/g by the relations:<br>\((f+g)(x)=f(x)+g(x)\)<br>\((f-g)(x)=f(x)-g(x)\)<br>\((fg)(x)=f(x)g(x)\)<br>\((f/g)(x)=f(x)/g(x)\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 1</strong></span><br>Performing Algebraic Operations on Functions<br>Find and simplify the functions \((g-f)(x)\) and \((g/f)(x)\), given<br>\(f(x)=x-1\) and<br>\(g(x)=x^2-1\). Are they the same function?<br><br>Solution:<br>begin by writing the general form, and then substitute the given functions.<br>\((g-f)(x) = g(x)-f(x)\)<br>\((g-f)(x) = x^2-1-(x-1)\)<br>\((g-f)(x) = x^2-x\)<br>\((g-f)(x) = x(x-1)\)<br><br>\((g/f)(x) = \frac{g(x)}{f(x)}\)<br>\((g/f)(x) = \frac{x^2-1}{x-1}\)<br>\((g/f)(x) = \frac{(x+1)(x-1)}{x-1}\)<br>\((g/f)(x) = x+1\)<br><br>No, the functions are not the same.<br>Note, for (g/f)(x), the condition \(x \not = 1\) is necessary because when<br>x=1, the denominator is equal to 0, which makes the function undefined.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Create a Function by Composition of Functions</strong></span><br>Performing algebraic operations on functions combines them into a new function,<br>but we can also create functions by composing functions. When we wanted<br>to compute a heating cost from a day of the year, we created a new function<br>that takes a day as input and yields a cost as output. The process of combining<br>functions so that the output of one function becomes the input of another is<br>known as the composition of functions. The resulting function is known as a<br>composition function. We represent this combination by the following notation:<br><br>\(f \circ g)(x)=f(g(x))\)<br><br>We read the left-hand side as "f composed with g at x", and the right=hand side<br>as "f of g of x". The two sides of the equation have the same mathematical<br>meaning and are equal. The open circle is called the composition operator. We<br>use this operator mainly when we wish to emphasize the relationship between the<br>functions themselves without referring to any particular input value.<br>Composition is a binary operation that takes two functions and forms a new<br>function, much as addition or multiplication takes two numbers and gives a new<br>number. However, it is important not to confuse function composition with<br>multiplication because, as we learned above, in most cases<br>\(f(g(x))\not=f(x)g(x)\).<br><br>It is also important to understand the order of operations in evaluating a<br>composite function. We follow the usual convention with parentheses by starting<br>with the innermost parentheses first, and then working to the outside. In the<br>equation above, the function g takes the input x first and yields an output<br>g(x). Then the function f takes g(x) as an input and yields an output f(g(x)).<br><br>g(x), the output of g is the input of f<br><br>In general, \(f \circ g\) and \(g \circ f\) are different functions. in other<br>words, in many cases, \(f(g(x)) \not= g(f(x))\) for all x. We will also see that<br>sometimes two functions can be composed only in one specific order.<br><br>For example, if \(f(x)=x^2\) and \(g(x)=x+2\), then:<br>\(f(g(x))=f(x+2) = (x+2)^2 = x^2+4x+4\)<br>but:<br>\(g(f(x))=g(x^2) = x^2+2\)<br><br>These expressions are not equal for all values of x, so the two functions are<br>not equal. It is irrelevant that the expressions happen to be equal for the<br>single input value \(x=1/2\).<br><br>Note that the range of the inside function (first function to be evaluated)<br>needs to be within the domain of the outside function. Less formally, the<br>composition has to make sense in terms of inputs and outputs.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Composition of Functions</strong></span><br>When the output of one function is used as the input of another function, we<br>call the entire operation a composition of functions. For any input x and<br>functions f and g, this action defines a composite function, which we write as<br>\(f \circ g\) such that \((f \circ g)(x)=f(g(x))\).<br><br>The domain of the composite function \(f \circ g\) is all x such that x is in<br>the domain of g and g(x) is in the domain of f. It is important to realize that<br>the product of functions fg is not the same as the function composition f(g(x)),<br>because , in general, \(f(x)g(x)\not=f(g(x))\).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 2</strong></span><br>Determining Whether Compositions of Functions is Commutative<br>Using the functions provided, find f(g(x)) and g(f(x)). Determine whether the<br>composition of the functions is commutative.<br>\(f(x)=2x+1\) and \(g(x)=3-x\)<br><br>Solution:<br>Let's begin by substituting g(x) into f(x).<br>\(f(g(x))=2(3-x)+1 = 6-2x+1 = 7-2x\)<br><br>Now, we can substitute f(x) into g(x).<br>\(g(f(x))=3-(2x+1) = 3-2x-1 = -2x+2\)<br><br>We find that \(g(f(x)) \not= f(g(x))\), so the operation of function composition<br>is not commutative.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 3</strong></span><br>Interpreting Composite Functions<br>The function c(s) gives the number of calories burned completing s sit-ups, and<br>s(t) gives the number of sit-ups a person can complete in t minutes. Interpret<br>c(s(3)).<br><br>Solution:<br>The inside expression in the composition is s(3). Because the input to the<br>s-function is time, t=3 represents 3 minutes, and s(3) is the number of sit-ups<br>completed in 3 minutes.<br><br>Using s(3) as the input to the function c(s) gives us the number of calories<br>burned during the number of sit-ups that can be completed in 3 minutes, or<br>simply the number of calories burned in 3 minutes by doing sit-ups. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 4</strong></span><br>Investigating the Order of Function Composition<br>Suppose f(x) gives miles that can be driven in x hours and g(y) gives the<br>gallons of gas used in driving y miles. Which of the expressions is meaningful,<br>f(g(y)) or g(f(x))?<br><br>Solution:<br>The function \(y=f(x)\) is a function whose output is the number of miles driven<br>corresponding to the number of hours driven.<br>number of miles=f(number of hours)<br>The function g(y) is a function whose output is the number of gallons used<br>corresponding to the number of miles driven. This means:<br>number of gallons = g(number of miles)<br><br>The expression g(y) takes miles as the input and a number of gallons as the<br>output. The function f(x) requires a number of hours as the input. Trying to<br>input a number of gallons does not make sense. The expression f(g(y)) is<br>meaningless. <br><br>The expression f(x) takes hours as the input and a number of miles driven as the<br>output. The function g(y) requires a number of miles as the input. Using<br>f(x)(miles driven) as an input value for g(y), where gallons of gas depends on<br>miles driven, does make sense. The expression g(f(x)) makes sense, and will<br>yield the number of gallons of gas used, g, driving a certain number of miles,<br>f(x), in x hours.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Are there any situations where f(g(y)) and g(f(x)) would both be meaningful or</strong></span><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>useful expressions?</strong></span><br>Yes. For many pure mathematical functions, both compositions make sense, even<br>though they usually produce different new functions. In real-world problems,<br>functions whose inputs and outputs have the same units also may give<br>compositions that are meaningful in either order.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Evaluating Composite Functions</strong></span><br>Once we compose a new function from two existing functions, we need to be able<br>to evaluate it for any input in its domain. We will do this with specific<br>numerical inputs for functions expressed as tables, graphs, and formulas and<br>with variables as inputs to functions expressed as formulas. In each case, we<br>evaluate the inner function using the starting input and then use the inner<br>function's output as the input for the outer function.<br><br>When working with functions given as tables, we read input and output values<br>from the table entries and always work from the inside to the outside. We<br>evaluate the inside function first and then use the output as of the inside<br>function as the input to the outside function.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 5</strong></span><br>Using a Table to Evaluate a Composite Function<br>Evaluate f(g(3)) and g(f(3)).<br><br>x     f(x)     g(x)<br>1     6        3<br>2     8        5<br>3     3        2<br>4     1        7<br><br>Solution:<br>To evaluate f(g(3)), we start from the inside with the input value 3. We then<br>evaluate the inside expression g(3) using the table that defines the function<br>g:g(3)=2. We can then use that result as the input to the function f, sp g(3) is<br>replaced by 2 and we get f(2). Then using the table that defines the function f,<br>we find that f(2)=8.<br>\(g(3)=2\)<br>\(f(g(3))=f(2)=8\)<br><br>To evaluate g(f(3)), we first evaluate the inside expression f(3) using the<br>first table: f(3)=3. Then, using the table for g, we can evaluate:<br>\(g(f(3))=g(3)-2\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Evaluating Composite Functions Using Graphs</strong></span><br>When we are given individual functions as graphs, the procedure for evaluating<br>composite functions is similar to the process we use for evaluating tables. We<br>read the input and output values, but this time, from the x and y axes of the<br>graphs.<br><br>Given a composite function and graphs of its individual functions, evaluate it<br>using the information provided by the graphs.<br>1. Locate the given input to the inner function on the x-axis of its graph<br>1. Read off the input of the inner function from the y-axis of its graph<br>3. Locate the inner function output on the x-axis of the graph of the outer<br>function.<br>4. Read the output of the outer function from the y-axis of its graph. This is<br>the output of the composite function.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 6</strong></span><br>Using a Graph to Evaluate a Composite Function<br>Evaluate f(g(1))<br><br>Solution:<br>We evaluate g(1) using the graph of g(x), finding the input of 1 on the x-axis<br>and finding the output value of the graph at that input. Here, g(1)=3. We<br>use this value as the input to the function f.<br>\(f(g(1))=f(3)\)<br>We can then evaluate the composite function by looking to the graph of f(x),<br>finding the input of 3 on the x-axis and reading the output value of the graph<br>at this input. Here, \(f(3)=6, \text{ so } f(g(1))=6\).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Evaluating Composite Functions Using Formulas</strong></span><br>When evaluating a composite function where we have either created or been<br>given formulas, the rule of working from the inside out remains the same. The<br>input value to the outer function will be the output of the inner function,<br>which may be a numerical value, a variable name, or a more complicated<br>expression. <br><br>While we can compose the functions for each individual input value, it is<br>sometimes helpful to find a single formula that will calculate the result of a<br>composition \(f9g(x))\). To do this, we will extend our idea of the function<br>evaluation. Recall that, when we evaluate a function like \(f(t)=t^2-t\), we<br>substitute the value inside the parentheses into the formula wherever we see<br>the input variable. <br><br>Given a formula for a composite function, evaluate the function.<br>1. Evaluate the inside out function using the input value or variable<br>provided.<br>2. use the resulting output as the input to the outside function.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 7</strong></span><br>Evaluating a Composition of Functions Expressed as Formulas with a numerical<br>Input<br>Given \(f(t)=t^2-t\) and \(h(x)=3x+2\), evaluate f(h(1)).<br><br>Solution:<br>Because the inside expression is h(1), we start by evaluating h(x) at 1.<br>\(h(1)=3(1)+2 = 5\)<br>Then \(f(h(1))=f(5)\), so we evaluate f9t) at an input of 5.<br>\(f(h(1))= f(5) = 5^2-5 = 20\)<br><br>It makes no difference what the input variables t and x were called because we<br>evaluated for specific numerical values.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Finding the Domain of a Composite Function</strong></span><br>As we discussed previously, the domain of a composite function such as \(f<br>\circ g\) is dependent on the domain of g and the domain of f. It is<br>important to know when we can apply a composite function and when we<br>cannot, that is, to know the domain of a function such as \(f \circ g\). Let us<br>assume we know the domains of the functions f and g separately. If we write<br>the composite function for an input x as f(g(x)), we can see right away that x<br>must be a member of the domain of g in order for the expression to be<br>meaningful, because otherwise we cannot complete the inner function<br>evaluation. However, we can see right away that x must be a member of the domain<br>of f, otherwise the second function evaluation in f(g(x)) cannot be<br>completed, and the expression is still undefined. Thus the domain of \(f \circ<br>g\) consists of only those inputs in the domain of g that produce outputs from<br>g belonging to the domain of f. Note that the domain of f composed with g is<br>the set of all x such that x is in the domain of f composed with g is the<br>set of all x such that x is in the domain of g and g9x) is in the domain of<br>f.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Domain of a Composite Function</strong></span><br>The domain of a composite function f(g(x)) is the set of those inputs x in the<br>domain of g for which g(x) is in the domain of f.<br><br>Given a function composition f(g(x)), determine its domain<br>1. Find the domain of g<br>2. Find the domain of f<br>3. Find those inputs x in the domain of g for which g(x) is in the domain of<br>f. That is, exclude those inputs x from the domain of g for which g(x) is not<br>in the domain of f. The resulting set is the domain of \(f \circ g\).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 8</strong></span><br>Finding the Domain of a Composite Function<br>Find the domain of \((f \circ g)(x)\) where \(f(x)=5/(x-1) \text{ and } g(x) =<br>4/(3x-2)\).<br><br>Solution:<br>The domain of g(x) consists of all real numbers except \(x=2/3\), since that<br>input value would cause us to divide by 0. Likewise, the domain of f consists<br>of all real numbers except 1. So we need to exclude from the domain of g(x)<br>that value of x for which g9x)=1.<br><br>\(\frac{4}{3x-2} = 1\)<br>\(4=3x-2\)<br>\(6=3x = 2\)<br><br>So the domain of \(f \circ g\) is the set of all real numbers except 2/3 and 2.<br>This means that :<br>\(x \not= \frac{2}{3} \text{ or } x\not=2\)<br>We can write this in interval notation as:<br>\((-\infty,\frac{2}{3}) \cup (\frac{2}{3},2) \cup (2,\infty)\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 9</strong></span><br>Finding the Domain of a Composite Function Involving Radicals<br>Find the domain of :<br>\((f \circ g)(x) \text{ where } f(x) = \sqrt{x+2} \text{ and } g(x) =<br>\sqrt{3-x}\)<br><br>Solution:<br>Because we cannot take the square root of a negative number, the domain of g<br>is \(-\infty,3]. Now we can check the domain of the composite function:<br>\((f \circ g)(x) = \sqrt{\sqrt{3-x}+2}\)<br>This expression must \(\geq 0\), since the radicand of a square root must be<br>positive. Since square roots are positive, \(\sqrt{3-x} \geq 0\) which gives<br>the domain of \((-\infty,3].<br><br>This example shows that knowledge of the range of functions (specifically<br>the inner function) can also be helpful in finding the domain of a composite<br>function. It also shows that the domain of \(f \circ g\) can contain values<br>that are not in the domain of f, though they must be in the domain of g.<br><br>Decomposing a Composite Function into its Component Functions<br>In some cases, it is necessary to decompose a complicated function. In<br>other words, we can write it as a composition of two simpler functions. There<br>may be more than one way to decompose a composite function, so we may<br>choose the decomposition that appears to be most expedient.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 10</strong></span><br>Decomposing a Function<br>Write \(f(x)=\sqrt{5-x^2}\) as the composition of two functions.<br><br>We are looking for two functions, g and h, so f(x)=g(h(x)). To do this,<br>we look for a function inside a function in the formula for f(x). As one<br>possibility, we might notice that the expression \(5-x^2\) is the inside of<br>the square root. We could then decompose the function as \(h(x)=5-x^2 \text{<br>and } g(x) = \sqrt{x}\)<br>We can check out answer by recomposing the functions.<br>\(g(h(x))=g(5-x^2)=\sqrt{5-x^2}\)<br><br> <br><br></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 7, 2024</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/precalculus/">mathematics</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fcomposition-of-functions-in-precalculus.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fcomposition-of-functions-in-precalculus.html&amp;via=Science%20By%20Jason&amp;text=Composition%20of%20Functions%20in%20Precalculus" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/rates-of-change-in-precalculus.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Rates of Change in Precalculus</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/transformation-of-functions-in-precalculus.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Transformation of Functions in Precalculus </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-08-12T19:22" class="feed__date">August 12, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/inequalities-with-quadratic-functions.html" class="invert">Inequalities with Quadratic Functions</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-08-07T17:39" class="feed__date">August 7, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/quadratic-models-in-precalculus.html" class="invert">Quadratic Models in Precalculus</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-08-02T13:57" class="feed__date">August 2, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/transformation-of-functions-in-precalculus.html" class="invert">Transformation of Functions in Precalculus</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></script></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Jason Moore 2021</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
