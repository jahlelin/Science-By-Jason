Then this quick beginning Latex tutorial is for you. Your paper needs to be accurate and look good. You then go to your favorite word processor to type things out. It is then you discover, maybe for the first time, that regular text editors can not do math very well. You may be trying to displayÂ physics equations,Â biology genes, orÂ chemical formulas.</p><p>Whichever it is, you realize you have to be super creative to even approach the accuracy that you want. At this point you will probably start asking around or researching the best way to do this. Well let me tell you folks, there is a better way. Â This is when most people find out about the wonderful Latex typesetting environment.

We have always wondered. Even in modern times where we know many things, we still wonder how modern astronomy evolved. As science and technology evolved, our understanding of astronomy has increased steadily though. Stargazing will forever be popular and rightly so.
