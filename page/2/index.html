Stars are classified based on their temperature, but started out being based on only their spectra. This classification process started in theÂ 1890sÂ by Edward Pickering at Harvard and was finished in 1901 by Annie Cannon, who worked for Pickering. Cannon reorganized what Pickering started in the classification that we know today. The classification is as follows "O B A F G K M" that goes from the hottest stars to the coolest stars. These classifications are further subdivided in categories "0-9" where 0 refers to early in that star and 9 refers to a late type of star.</p><p style="text-align: left;">This classification is now called the Harvard Spectral Classification. Type O stars and Type B stars are both blue-white hot stars, but Type O stars are the hottest stars. Type A stars are white stars that give offÂ BalmerÂ absorption lines in early A stars. Type F stars are yellow-white stars. Type G stars are yellow stars like our Sun. Type K stars are cool orange stars, whose spectra is dominated by metal absorption lines. Type M stars are cool red stars, whose spectra is full of molecular absorption lines. The Sun is classified as a TypeÂ G2Â star with a surface temperature of 5777 Kelvin. These spectral classes also relate to the surface temperatures of the stars.</p><div>Â </div><div>Â </div><a href="https://ScienceByJason.com/what-are-star-classifications-and-their-life-cycles.html" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://ScienceByJason.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="feed__author invert">Jason Moore</a> <time datetime="2016-03-31T14:18" class="feed__date">March 31, 2016</time></div><h2><a href="https://ScienceByJason.com/what-is-the-purpose-of-dna-in-biology.html" class="invert">What Is The Purpose Of DNA In Biology?</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/clinic-doctor-health-hospital.jpg" data-srcset="https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/responsive/clinic-doctor-health-hospital-xs.jpg 300w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/responsive/clinic-doctor-health-hospital-sm.jpg 480w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/responsive/clinic-doctor-health-hospital-md.jpg 768w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/responsive/clinic-doctor-health-hospital-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/responsive/clinic-doctor-health-hospital-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/2/responsive/clinic-doctor-health-hospital-2xl.jpg 1600w" data-aspectratio="1.5023474178403755" data-sizes="auto" height="426" width="640" alt=""></div><div class="wrapper"><h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Purpose Of DNA</strong></span></h1><div>Biology is one of those subjects that take a while to get used to.

It is one of the first topics a biology student encounters that is unclear. It isn't really unclear though. It just does a lot of complicated things. It holds much of our biological data and it determines who you and successive generations will become. It is made up of the well known double helix you see plastic models of in all the labs.</div><div></div><div></div><a href="https://ScienceByJason.com/what-is-the-purpose-of-dna-in-biology.html" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://ScienceByJason.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="feed__author invert">Jason Moore</a> <time datetime="2016-03-21T11:50" class="feed__date">March 21, 2016</time></div><h2><a href="https://ScienceByJason.com/how-modern-astronomy-evolved.html" class="invert">How Modern Astronomy Evolved</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/1/MonR2.jpg" data-srcset="https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/1/responsive/MonR2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/1/responsive/MonR2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/1/responsive/MonR2-md.jpg 768w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/1/responsive/MonR2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/1/responsive/MonR2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/1/responsive/MonR2-2xl.jpg 1600w" data-aspectratio="0.98" data-sizes="auto" height="700" width="686" alt=""></div><div class="wrapper"><div>Stargazing has always inspired people to wonder what was out there in the night sky. Some thought the stars were past relatives or ghosts. Others thought they were Gods. One thing for sure was that no one knew for sure. From the beginning of time this has been the case. We have always wondered. Even in modern times where we know many things, we still wonder how modern astronomy evolved. As science and technology evolved, our understanding of astronomy has increased steadily though. Stargazing will forever be popular and rightly so. How modern astronomy evolved will forever be a journey to people.</div><div>Â </div><a href="https://ScienceByJason.com/how-modern-astronomy-evolved.html" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><nav class="wrapper pagination desc"><div class="pagination__item"><a href="https://ScienceByJason.com/" class="readmore">Next </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://ScienceByJason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></nav></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Jason Moore 2019</div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://ScienceByJason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
