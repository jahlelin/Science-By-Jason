It's not for lack of trying though. We are constantly refining our ideas and collecting knowledge. This process started thousands of years ago and I hope it continues for another thousand years. The picture below shows the wondrous nature of this field.</p><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Science Methods</strong></h3><p>The main reasons for our eventual increase of knowledge were better telescopes and improved scientific methods. Better telescopes allowed us to see stars better and make better judgements. Galileo was the first who really made significant improvements to the telescope. He refined what it did and indeed made it better.  Refracting telescopes were what he used and improved.</p><p>They had their issues though which is why the reflecting telescope was then invented. Reflecting telescopes bypassed the limitations of the refracting telescope. It allowed even further refinement to celestial images of the day. How modern astronomy evolved depended very much on establishing methods to test and review results.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">Ask a question</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Form an hypothesis</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Make a prediction</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Test the prediction</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Analyze it</span></li></ul><div> </div><p>That is roughly the scientific method. It never really ends though. You keep making more hypotheses, more tests, and more analyses. This process helped early scientists sort through early ideas.</p><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Systems</strong></h3><p>What good were these new devices if we did not use them well? This is where scientific method and the development of systematic observation made good use of the new telescopes we now had.  With a defined set of procedures, science itself progressed more quickly. Why is the scientific method important? For one it formalizes the process. This means that everyone is testing and evaluating observations and results in the same way.</p><p>It was important because you could eliminate things that did not make sense and gain an interesting answer much quicker than just guessing your way through it. That is my analysis anyway. With a system of observation now in place, everyone could make assertions based off equal conditions. If done correctly, there should be no outlandish results. Everything that was then inferred had at least a chance of being correct until more testing and observation was done.</p><div> </div><div> </div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Better Telescopes</strong></h3><p> </p><figure class="aligncenter wp-image-4474 size-full"><img title="how modern astronomy evolved" src="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/telescope1.gif" alt="how modern astronomy evolved" data-aspectratio="0.858462" width="558" height="650"></figure><p><a href="http://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-how-telescopes-are-used/">Telescopes</a> have not been around for very long. There are many claims for earlier telescopes but even then the 1500's is the earliest it could have appeared. Galileo developed the first good one it seems. It used concave lenses. He used it to start observing various planets and other objects in the night sky.</p><p>This happened around 1609 and was the turning point for Astronomy. He continued to improve his designs throughout his career.<br>Johannes Kepler again made another great improvement by using a convex lens. This greatly magnified objects in space. Switching to this style also gave him a much larger field of view.</p><p>This was very helpful. His telescopes suffered from light distortion which today is called chromatic aberration.<br>Johannus Hevelius wanted to construct longer telescopes because he theorized that the longer they were the sharper they would be. It was reported that he developed one that was 140 feet long! The telescope was impractical to use much because it kept moving.</p><p>Isaac Newton developed the first reflector telescope using a mirror and a combination of lenses. This was a huge discovery. There were still problems but viewing instruments were getting better.</p><p>Sir William Herschel was the great Astronomer who built a huge reflector telescope with a 4 foot mirror in it. The advantage of this is that it could gather much more light. This helped resolve pictures much more clearly.</p><div> </div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Heliocentrism</strong></h3><div> </div><div> </div><div><figure class="aligncenter wp-image-25 size-large"><img class="lazyload" title="how modern astronomy evolved" data-src="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/sun_nustar_2016-1024x520.jpg" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/responsive/sun_nustar_2016-1024x520-xs.jpg 300w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/responsive/sun_nustar_2016-1024x520-sm.jpg 480w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/responsive/sun_nustar_2016-1024x520-md.jpg 768w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/responsive/sun_nustar_2016-1024x520-lg.jpg 1024w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/responsive/sun_nustar_2016-1024x520-xl.jpg 1360w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/responsive/sun_nustar_2016-1024x520-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="how modern astronomy evolved" data-aspectratio="1.969231" width="1024" height="520"></figure></div><div> </div><div> </div><div><strong> </strong>This led to the heliocentric view of our galaxy.  This idea contrasted greatly with the predominant view of most people. Most, since anyone thought about it, thought that our own planet was the center of our galaxy and all there was.</div><div> </div><div>While we know this is wrong today, you can not really blame those who first thought it.This earth was all that was understood and that was just on a basic level. Because of that, it took a long time for people to accept that everything in our galaxy would revolve around the <a href="http://sciencebyjason.com/star-classifications-life-cycles/">Sun</a>. It was just too new of a concept and something that very few could understand.</div><div> </div><div>How modern astronomy evolved , though , would have to lead us toward heliocentrism eventually anyway. Our little earth and many other heavenly bodies have some kind of orbit around the star that is our sun.You would think that the life-giving light and radiation from the Sun would make it seem more important to our ancestors.</div><div> </div><div>Indeed, not many made this connection. Nicolaus Copernicus was one of the very few. He was the most influential man in Astronomy. He read a lot of history books and anything on Astronomy. After he proposed his heliocentric view of the solar system he became very unpopular. No one believed in this new system.</div><div> </div><div>However, the math that he and many others had been working on suddenly worked out when you considered the Sun at the center of our solar system. He published his theories a year before his death. He did this in case there was major backlash with the church. There would be of course.His heliocentric theory was revolutionary even after all the troubles it caused himself and others. We now know it to be accurate and was the key to finding more planets in our <a href="http://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-the-solar-system/">solar system</a>.</div><div> </div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Celestial Mechanics</strong></h3><p> </p><figure class="aligncenter wp-image-4475 size-full"><img title="how modern astronomy evolved" src="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/cm1.gif" alt="how modern astronomy evolved" data-aspectratio="1.333333" width="720" height="540"></figure><p> </p><p>This topic deals with how the many objects, <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-the-stars.html">stars</a> for example, in our solar system and how they are affected by other celestial bodies. This really confused people for literally ages. First, without the idea of heliocentrism mentioned above, these principles could not even begin to take off. If you think about the words, celestial mechanics, it really how it sounds. It is the mechanics that we know and love applied to celestial objects.</p><p>Celestial mechanics is ultimately the doing of Johannes Kepler. His laws of planetary motion were instrumental in explaining the motion of celestial bodies. This motion showed how everything interacted with each other. The key equation behind these laws of his was:<br>\(F = \frac{G*m1*m2}{r^2}\)</p><p>It described the gravitational force that any two particular objects exerted on each other. This equation therefore says that the masses of those objects are multiplied together along with the gravitational constant. Then divide this figure by the square of the distance between the two bodies.</p><p>When we use this equation on all of the planets, moons, and other objects, we then see a better picture of what is going on in our solar system.<br>Now Newton had his theories about celestial mechanics but it was Kepler that solidified everything that they knew in that time.</p><p>This theory made it know that the Sun was the major force in the solar system. All other objects of any significant size acted upon everything else too. If the effect was too small then the effect would not be measurable. When all of this was taken into account it made it easy to predict planets and their locations during orbits.</p><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Gravity</strong></h3><p> </p><figure class="aligncenter wp-image-4476 size-full"><img class="lazyload" title="how modern astronomy evolved" data-src="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/gravity1.jpg" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/responsive/gravity1-xs.jpg 300w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/responsive/gravity1-sm.jpg 480w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/responsive/gravity1-md.jpg 768w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/responsive/gravity1-lg.jpg 1024w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/responsive/gravity1-xl.jpg 1360w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/responsive/gravity1-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="how modern astronomy evolved" data-aspectratio="1.428571" width="600" height="420"></figure><p> </p><p> </p><div>The laws of gravity were the next huge accomplishment. They spurred great innovations and knowledge about how bodies in space interact with each other. You see, everything in space has some effect on something else. It can be a very minor effect like causing a slight wobble as something passes by. A more prominent example would be our Earth keeping the <a href="http://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-the-moon/">Moon</a> close by which is due to gravity as well.</div><div> </div><div>It can also be a huge effect like bringing the object into orbit because it got too close.Even objects that get taken into orbit of a larger mass slightly effect that larger mass. I will say it again, everything in space affects something else to some degree. This is because of gravity.You might then ask what exactly is gravity?</div><div> </div><div>Well we are still working on that. There are many ideas of course. Newton said it was a force and that every object in the universe has an attraction on everything else. The masses of any 2 objects you select and their respective distances apart will tell you what force is applied on each.</div><div> </div><div>Unless at least one of the objects are very large, however, the effects are so slight you will not notice.So telling the pretty girl sitting next to you that the closer we get the more attraction we will have for each other will probably not work. I know, I tried it once during high school. She did not look convinced.Gravity has an effect on everything.</div><div> </div><div>It is part of our daily lives. It always has been. Its effect at the Earth's surface is \(9.8 \frac{m}{s^2}\). The force is one of acceleration. This means that for every \(s^2\) our acceleration increases by \(9.8\) if we are in free fall. The effect of gravity is also different on every other celestial object in space.</div><div> </div><div> </div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Light and Distance</strong></h3><p> </p><div> </div><div><figure class="aligncenter wp-image-26 size-large"><img class="lazyload" title="how modern astronomy evolved" data-src="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/ComaCluster_hubble_1280-1-1024x727.jpg" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/responsive/ComaCluster_hubble_1280-1-1024x727-xs.jpg 300w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/responsive/ComaCluster_hubble_1280-1-1024x727-sm.jpg 480w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/responsive/ComaCluster_hubble_1280-1-1024x727-md.jpg 768w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/responsive/ComaCluster_hubble_1280-1-1024x727-lg.jpg 1024w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/responsive/ComaCluster_hubble_1280-1-1024x727-xl.jpg 1360w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/responsive/ComaCluster_hubble_1280-1-1024x727-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="how modern astronomy evolved" data-aspectratio="1.408528" width="1024" height="727"></figure></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> These developments led us to better understand the speed of light and distances in our galaxy. The speed of light is pretty fast. More accurately, it is the fastest thing we know of for sure. There have been guesses that other things in space might be faster but right now that is all conjecture.</div><div> </div><div>Knowing this speed allowed us to then measure distances to many objects in space.For example you can measure the distance to a comet and then a week later do it again. By doing this you get an idea of how fast it is moving and its direction of movement. See how this is important?</div><div> </div><div>Now that we can measure distances we begin to understand the vast distances to other planets and stars.  Maybe understand is too much credit but at least we are starting to get an idea. Once astronomers started getting distances for everything and their movements, they realized how much more there was to learn. This opened up many avenues of study.  How modern astronomy evolved led us toward discovering the vast distances in space as you can see below.</div><div> </div><div> </div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Spectroscopy</strong></h3><p> </p><figure class="aligncenter wp-image-4477 size-full"><img class="lazyload" title="how modern astronomy evolved" data-src="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/spec1.jpg" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/responsive/spec1-xs.jpg 300w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/responsive/spec1-sm.jpg 480w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/responsive/spec1-md.jpg 768w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/responsive/spec1-lg.jpg 1024w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/responsive/spec1-xl.jpg 1360w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/responsive/spec1-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="how modern astronomy evolved" data-aspectratio="1.500000" width="450" height="300"></figure><p> </p><p>Once a reasonable level of understanding had been gained of the speed of light and distances, astronomers began focusing more on the light being emitted from stars and planets. Just about everything broadcasts some sort of light or <a href="http://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-radiation/">radiation</a>. Looking at this light and analyzing it became huge for inferring a lot of characteristics about stars. Over time scientists of the day realized they could look at different wavelengths of light.</p><p>This development yielded a great deal of additional information. Using a spectroscope, astronomers studied the light captured and could tell how hot the star was and partly what it was even made of. Once it was known how hot it was, you could then infer its age and size based other conditions.</p><p>Knowing what it was made of also helped. Stars with higher compositions of some elements had different characteristics than stars with other compositions. This became an important field of study called <a href="http://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-spectroscopy/">spectroscopy</a>.</p><div> </div><div> </div><div> Basically that is where we are now in modern times. There are, of course better technology innovations and telescopes out in space to get more accurate readings. Everything is progressing steadily like it always has. We are gaining insight continually and our understanding of the <a href="http://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-guide-to-the-universe/">universe</a> slowly evolves. Will we ever have a true understanding?</div><p>Probably not but it is seeing and discovering the wonders that is out there that has always kept us trying and hopefully forever will. How modern Astronomy evolved is a fascinating subject. Looking at past developments can also give us clues today.</p><p> </p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What are Star Classifications</strong></h3><p style="text-align: left;">Have you ever wondered about <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-the-stars.html">star</a> classifications ? Stars are classified based on their temperature, but started out being based on only their spectra. This classification process started in the 1890s by Edward Pickering at Harvard and was finished in 1901 by Annie Cannon, who worked for Pickering. Cannon reorganized what Pickering started in the classification that we know today. The classification is as follows "O B A F G K M" that goes from the hottest stars to the coolest stars. These classifications are further subdivided in categories "0-9" where 0 refers to early in that star and 9 refers to a late type of star.</p><p style="text-align: left;">This classification is now called the Harvard Spectral Classification. Type O stars and Type B stars are both blue-white hot stars, but Type O stars are the hottest stars. Type A stars are white stars that give off Balmer absorption lines in early A stars. Type F stars are yellow-white stars. Type G stars are yellow stars like our Sun. Type K stars are cool orange stars, whose spectra is dominated by metal absorption lines. Type M stars are cool red stars, whose spectra is full of molecular absorption lines. The Sun is classified as a Type G2 star with a surface temperature of 5777 Kelvin. These spectral classes also relate to the surface temperatures of the stars.</p><div> </div><div> </div><p> </p><div> </div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram</strong></h3><div> </div><div>The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, commonly called the H-R diagram, is a diagram that plots the stars luminosity (or brightness) versus their spectral classifications, which relate to their temperature.

This collapse can be initiated by the shock waves of a supernova or by gravity of objects/stars close to the cloud. The collapse of the cloud creates "protostars," which are similar to stars, yet they lack the heat at the core to star the nuclear reactions need for a star. There is quite a bit of math relating to gravity, the velocity of the material around the protostar, and the size of the cloud, but that would be too involved for just an overview of stars. As the protostar collapses the material close to the center flattens into a disk and it becomes even hotter.</div><div> </div><div>If the protostar does not have enough mass to start the nuclear reaction process, then it will contract because of it's gravity and become a brown dwarf. If the protostar has enough mass for nuclear reactions at the core, then the disk of material will continue to spiral inward. Many young stars can acquire a magnetic field, which trap material and ejects it at the poles. While this is occurring, the star is still collapsing and can go through a period of instability before it becomes a main-sequence star. The star will then stay on the main-sequence for the majority of its life.</div><div> </div><div>The luminosity and lifetime of the star both depend on the nuclear reactions taking place in the core, which in turn is determined from the mass and composition. All of these factors contribute to star classifications and how they are made.</div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div><figure class="aligncenter wp-image-53"><img class="lazyload" data-src="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/Image2-300x191.png" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/responsive/Image2-300x191-xs.png 300w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/responsive/Image2-300x191-sm.png 480w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/responsive/Image2-300x191-md.png 768w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/responsive/Image2-300x191-lg.png 1024w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/responsive/Image2-300x191-xl.png 1360w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/responsive/Image2-300x191-2xl.png 1600w" alt="Image2" data-aspectratio="1.570694" width="611" height="389"></figure></div><div> </div><p class="align-center"><strong>Main Sequence</strong></p><p> </p><div> Eventually, the main-sequence star will exhaust the hydrogen that causes the nuclear reactions in the core. This causes the star to become unstable and increase in size. The death of a main-sequence star is determined by its mass. Low-mass stars collapse and evolve into black dwarfs. Solar-mass stars become a red giant star, and it becomes more unstable.</div><div> </div><div>This instability causes the outer layers of the star to blow away, which creates a planetary nebula that has a white dwarf at the center. A white dwarf is a small and dense star with a mass similar to Earth. High-mass stars become supergiant stars, which explode in a supernova. After the supernova, the remains can either form a neutron star or a black hole.</div><div> </div><div>Like everything else related to the life of a star, whether it becomes a neutron star or a black holes depends on its mass as a main-sequence star. Neutron stars are small and very dense, which consist of neutrons. The collisions between these neutrons creates a powerful magnetic field that causes beams to emerge from its poles. A black hole occurs if a star's collapse does not end as a neutron star. This means that the mass of the star going supernova is greater than one that collapses to a neutron star. Black holes have a gravity to them that does not even allow light to escape.</div><div> </div><div><img class="lazyload" data-src="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/Image(1).png" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/responsive/Image(1)-xs.png 300w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/responsive/Image(1)-sm.png 480w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/responsive/Image(1)-md.png 768w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/responsive/Image(1)-lg.png 1024w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/responsive/Image(1)-xl.png 1360w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/responsive/Image(1)-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" data-aspectratio="1.570621" width="2224" height="1416"></div><div> </div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Binary Stars</strong></h3><div><strong> </strong></div><div>A binary star is composed of a system of two stars that are orbiting around a common center of mass. It is thought that a vast majority of stars in the universe are part of a binary system (or an even higher-multiple system). The distance between binary stars and their orbital periods vary greatly. Binary stars are classified by how they are detected. The classification is as follows: optical double, visual binary, astrometric binary, eclipsing binary, spectrum binary, and spectroscopic binary.</div><div> </div><div>Optical doubles are not binary systems, instead they are simply stars that appear along the same line of sight. Visual binaries are binary stars where both stars can be resolved independently and their motion is able to be monitored.</div><div> </div><div>Astrometric binaries are binary systems where one star is considerably brighter than the second star. This means it may not be possible to see both stars, but it can be determined by other methods. Eclipsing binaries are located along our line of sight where the stars periodically pass in front of each other. When one star passes in front of another there is light that is being blocked. Spectrum binaries are systems with two superimposed and observable spectra.

Eventually, they start to run out of fuel, which causes changes. Different things can happen at this point. It starts changing from the inside, its appearance changes, and it might explode. Whether a star explodes or not, depends on its mass at the time. Lower mass stars just go out. They turn into white dwarfs. Higher mass stars will explode.

They can then piece these together to get an idea of how they evolve from a disk to an explosion. These main sequence stars turn hydrogen into helium.

For a star to keep evolving, it will need to fuse heavy elements, such as carbon. When it successfully does this, it will get to its next stage. From there, depending on its mass, it might explode into a fiery shower of debris. This often can leave a planetary nebula in its place. These are not related to <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/planets-of-our-solar-system.html">planets of our solar system</a> however. Its just an old term that was wrongly used but stuck with us. However, if the core temperature is not high enough, these processes will not happen. Instead, there will be no more fusion and the core will eventually cool. It will still take a long time, but the cooling effect means it will turn into a white dwarf. A white dwarf star is one that is no longer burning at its core. It does have a lot of residual heat, which can be seen as it glows.</p><figure class="post__image"><img class="lazyload" data-src="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/36/stellarevolution-7.jpg" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/36/responsive/stellarevolution-7-xs.jpg 300w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/36/responsive/stellarevolution-7-sm.jpg 480w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/36/responsive/stellarevolution-7-md.jpg 768w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/36/responsive/stellarevolution-7-lg.jpg 1024w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/36/responsive/stellarevolution-7-xl.jpg 1360w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/36/responsive/stellarevolution-7-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" data-aspectratio="1.339310" width="1942" height="1450"></figure><h3 class="align-center"><br>Lifetime Of Stars</h3><p><br>This is related to previous points that I have made but I wanted to be more specific. Thee lifetime of a star depends on its mass. This mass was decided early on in its original cluster. The lower the mass, the longer the star will survive. If its smaller than our Sun it will last billions of years. However much of that time it will just be a shell that is slowly cooling off. It will have no internal activity. Its fate is to be a cold, dead, rock, sort of like our moon. However, <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-the-moon.html">our moon</a> was never star so don't get confused. In <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-the-solar-system.html">the solar system</a> we live in, this should be the fate of our Sun someday.</p><p>A high mass star will have a much different fate. The more mass it is the shorter its lifetime will be. If it is a lot larger than our Sun, then it will only be around for a few million years. That is a great difference. The reason why, as stated above, is that its mass and temperatures are so high that it will trigger a violent explosion. All that will be left, could just be a planetary nebula and <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-space-debris.html">space debris</a>. This nebular is just a gas shell that is just a faint reminder of what was once there.</p><figure class="post__image"><img class="lazyload" data-src="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/36/stellarevolution-8.jpg" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/36/responsive/stellarevolution-8-xs.jpg 300w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/36/responsive/stellarevolution-8-sm.jpg 480w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/36/responsive/stellarevolution-8-md.jpg 768w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/36/responsive/stellarevolution-8-lg.jpg 1024w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/36/responsive/stellarevolution-8-xl.jpg 1360w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/36/responsive/stellarevolution-8-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" data-aspectratio="0.995399" width="649" height="652"></figure><p><br>In this article today I have talked about the stellar evolution of a star, which is part of my <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-essentials.html">astronomy essentials</a> series. This evolution is very dependent on its original mass. This mass determines whether the star will end up as a cold dead rock or blow up in small pieces across the galaxy. So, their lifetimes can be very different in actual spans. Their life spans can be tracked, depending on where they are in the main sequence. The main sequence is sort of a <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-guide-to-the-universe.html">guide to the universe</a> for stars because we classify all of them there. I hope you liked this article, and if so, please subscribe for more of my thoughts on computing and science.</p></div><div> </div><p><img class="lazyload" data-src="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/alberio_visual.jpg" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/responsive/alberio_visual-xs.jpg 300w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/responsive/alberio_visual-sm.jpg 480w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/responsive/alberio_visual-md.jpg 768w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/responsive/alberio_visual-lg.jpg 1024w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/responsive/alberio_visual-xl.jpg 1360w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/responsive/alberio_visual-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" data-aspectratio="3.317797" width="783" height="236"></p><div> </div><h1 style="text-align: center;"> </h1><p> </p><div class="post-editor-topbar"> </div></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 9, 2020</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://ScienceByJason.com/astronomy/">Astronomy</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2FScienceByJason.com%2Fastronomy-essentials.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://ScienceByJason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2FScienceByJason.com%2Fastronomy-essentials.html&amp;via=Science%20By%20Jason&amp;text=Astronomy%20Essentials" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://ScienceByJason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://ScienceByJason.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://ScienceByJason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://ScienceByJason.com/a-first-look-at-algebra-and-number-sets.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> A First Look At Algebra and Number Sets</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://ScienceByJason.com/the-evolution-of-stars.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> The Evolution Of Stars </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://ScienceByJason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2017-05-13T14:37" class="feed__date">May 13, 2017</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://ScienceByJason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-the-solar-system.html" class="invert">Astronomy For Beginners: The Solar System</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2017-03-01T22:40" class="feed__date">March 1, 2017</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://ScienceByJason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-how-telescopes-are-used.html" class="invert">Astronomy For Beginners: How Telescopes Are Used</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2017-01-24T20:25" class="feed__date">January 24, 2017</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://ScienceByJason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-spectroscopy.html" class="invert">Astronomy For Beginners: Spectroscopy</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><link href="//cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/classic-10_7.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><style type="text/css">#mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }
