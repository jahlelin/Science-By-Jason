They all convey uncertainty. By using probability, we can make<br>numerical statements about uncertainty. Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Sample Space</strong></span><br>Any process that results in an observation or an outcome is an experiment. An<br>experiment may have more than one possible outcome. A set of all possible<br>outcomes of an experiment is known as a sample space. It is generally denoted<br>using the letter \(S\). <br><br>Tossing a coin will result in one of two possible outcomes, heads or tails.<br>Therefore, the sample space of tossing a coin is<br><br>\(S = {Heads, Tails}\)<br><br>Throwing a six sided die will result in one of six possible outcomes. The<br>resulting sample space is<br><br>\(S = {1,2,3,4,5,6}\)<br><br>Tossing two coins will result in one of four possible outcomes. We can indicate<br>the outcome of each of the two tosses by using a pair of letters, the first<br>letter of which indicates the outcome of tossing the first coin and the second<br>letter the outcome of tossing the second coin. H is for heads and T is for<br>tails. The resulting sample space is<br><br>\(S = {(H,H), (H,T), (T,H), (T,T)}\)<br><br>The outcomes listed in a sample space are never repeated, and no outcome is left<br>out. Two events are said to be equally likely if one does not occur more often<br>than the other. For example, the six possible outcomes for a throw of a die are<br>equally likely. <br><br>A tree diagram representation is useful in determining the sample space for an<br>experiment, especially if there are relatively few possible outcomes. For<br>example, imagine an experiment in which a die and a quarter are tossed together.<br>What are all the possible outcomes? The six possible outcomes of throwing a die<br>are 1,2,3,4,5,6. The two possible outcomes of using a quarter are Heads and<br>Tails. <br><br>The probability of an event is generally denoted by a capital P followed by the<br>name of the event in parentheses. If all the events in a sample space are<br>equally likely, the by using the concept of relative frequency, we can compute<br>the probability of an event as:<br><br>\(P(event) = \frac{true-outcomes}{total-outcomes}\)<br><br>Applying this to the events defined earlier:<br><br>\(P(A) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5\)<br>The probability of getting an even number when a six sided die is thrown is 0.5.<br>In other words, there is a 50% chance of getting an even number when a six sided<br>die is thrown.<br><br>\(P(B) = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25\)<br>The probability of getting two heads when two coins are tossed is 0.25. In other<br>words, there is a 25% chance of getting two heads when two coins are tossed.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Probability Rules and Terms</strong></span><br>There are two rules that all probability must satisfy.<br>Rule 1: For any event A, the probability of A is always greater than or equal to<br>0 and less than or equal to 1.<br>Rule 2: The sum of the probabilities for all possible outcomes in a sample space<br>is always 1.<br>So, if an event can never occur, its probability is 0. Such an event is known as<br>an impossible event.<br>If an event must occur every time, its probability is 1. Such an event is known<br>as a sure event. <br>The odds in favor of an event is a ratio of the probability of the occurrence of<br>an event to the probability of the nonoccurrence of that event. <br><br>\(Odds-of-event = \frac{P(Event-Occurs)}{P(Event-Doesn't-Occur)}\)<br>or:<br>\(P(Event-occurs) : P(Event-Doesn't-Occur)\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 1</strong></span><br>When tossing a die, what are the odds in favor of getting the number2?<br>When tossing a die:<br>\(P(2) = \frac{1}{6}\)<br>and:<br>\(P(not-2) = \frac{5}{6}\)<br>So, the odds in favor of getting the number 2 are \(\frac{1}{6}:\frac{5}{6} or<br>1:5\)<br><br>The Venn diagram illustrates some of the following terms. The rectangular box<br>indicates the sample space. Circles indicate different events. <br>The complement of an event is the set of all possible outcomes in a sample space<br>that do not lead to the event. The complement of an event is denoted by A'.<br>Disjoint or mutually exclusive events are events that have no outcome in common.<br>In other words, they cannot occur together. Two separate circles in a Venn<br>diagram are disjoint events. <br><br>The union of events A and B is the set of all possible outcomes that lead to at<br>least one of the two events A and B. The union of events A and B is denoted by<br>\(A-or-B\). The intersection of events A and B is the set of all possible<br>outcomes that lead to both events A and B. The intersection of events A and B is<br>denoted \(A-and-B\). <br>A conditional event: A given B is a set of outcomes for event A that occurs if B<br>has occurred. It is indicated by "A given B". Two events A and B are considered<br>independent if the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of<br>the other event. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Independence vs. Dependence</strong></span><br>Events happening that do not depend on each other are called independent. If the<br>events are related, then we call this a dependent event. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 2</strong></span><br>The sample space for throwing a die is S={1,2,3,4,5,6}. Suppose events A,B, and<br>C are defined as follows:<br>A=Getting an even number={2,4,6}<br>B=Getting at least 5={5,6}<br>C=Getting at most 3={1,2,3}<br>Find the probability of each of these events and its complement. Then, find the<br>union, intersection, and conditional probability of each pair of events.<br>Solution:<br>    \(P(A)=\frac{3}{6}=0.5\)<br>    \(P(B)=\frac{2}{6}=0.3\)<br>    \(P(C)=\frac{3}{6}=0.5\)<br>Complement:<br>A'=Getting an odd number={1,3,5}<br>    P(A')=\frac{3}{6}=0.5=1-P(A)<br>    B'=Getting a number less than 5={1,2,3,4}<br>        P(B')=\frac{4}{6}=0.6=1-P(B)<br>    C'=Getting a number larger than 3={4,5,6}<br>        P(C')=\frac{3}{6}=0.5=1-P(C)<br>Union:=<br>Getting an even number or a number greater than or equal to 5 or both<br>    ={2,4,5,6} = \(P(A-orB)=\frac{4}{6}=0.6\)<br>    A or C=Getting an even number or a number less than or equal to 3 or both<br>    ={1,2,3,4,6} = P(A or C)=\(\frac{5}{6}=0.83\)<br>    B or C=Getting a number that is at most 3 or at least 5 or both<br>    ={1,2,3,5,6} = P(B or C)=\(\frac{5}{6}=0.83\)<br>Intersection: <br>(A and B)=Getting an even number that is at least 5={6}<br>    P(A and B)=\(\frac{1}{6}=0.16\)<br>(A and C)=Getting an even number that is at most 3={2}<br>    P(A and C)= P(A and C)=\frac{1}{6}=0.16<br>(B and C)=Getting a number that is at most 3 and at least 5 ={}<br>    P(B and c)=\(\frac{0}{6} = 0 = 0.0\)<br>So, B and C are disjoint or mutually exclusive events.<br>Conditional Events:<br>    (A|C)=Getting an even number given that the number is at most 3={2}<br>        P(A!C)=\(\frac{1}{3}=0.3\)<br>    (A|B)=Getting an even number given that the number is at least 5={6}<br>        P(A!B)=\(\fgrac{1}{2}=0.5\)<br>    (B|C)=Getting at least 5 given that the number is at most 3 =0<br>        \(P(B|C)=0\)<br><br></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 22, 2024</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/statistics/">Statistics</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fprobability-in-statistics.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fprobability-in-statistics.html&amp;via=Science%20By%20Jason&amp;text=Probability%20In%20Statistics" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/methods-of-data-collection-in-statistics.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Methods Of Data Collection In Statistics</a></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-09-05T12:56" class="feed__date">September 5, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/working-with-tables-and-graphs-in-statistics.html" class="invert">Working with Tables and Graphs in Statistics</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-08-30T22:13" class="feed__date">August 30, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/what-statistics-is-all-about.html" class="invert">What Statistics Is All About</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-07-11T21:28" class="feed__date">July 11, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/organization-of-data-in-statistics.html" class="invert">Organization of Data in Statistics</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></script></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Jason Moore 2021</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
