These interrelations are described with<br>the four kinematic equations of motion.<br><br>In this section, we relate constant force to constant acceleration and then to<br>all of kinematics. Force can be defined as what makes masses accelerate.<br>Actually, it is the unbalanced force on a mass that makes it accelerate. So,<br>unbalanced forces make masses accelerate. <br><br>Force, acceleration, and mass are related by Newton's second law as F = ma.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 1</strong></span><br>A 40 N force is applied to a 20 kg block resting on a horizontal frictionless<br>table. Find the acceleration. <br><br>Solution:<br>The acceleration is \(a=\frac{f}{m} = \frac{40N}{20kg} = 2.0m/s^2\)<br>Once the acceleration is known, the kinematic equations of motion can be applied<br>to find position, velocity, and acceleration as a function of time.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 2</strong></span><br>Now place the 20 kg mass on a frictionless 50 degree inclined plane. What is the<br>acceleration of the mass?<br><br>Solution:<br>The force acting on the mass is due to gravity, so setup a vector diagram<br>starting with this 196 N force acting down. The mass is constrained to move down<br>the plane. The gravitational force is shown with components down the plane and<br>normal to the plane. Notice the geometry of the situation, where the 50 degree<br>angle of the plane is the same as the angle between the gravitational force and<br>the normal force. <br><br>So, the force straight down is \(F=20kg(9.8m/s^2)=196N\)<br>However, the mass is going down an incline plane at 50 degrees.<br>\(F_{p}=(196N)(sin50)=150N\)<br>The 150 N force acting down the plane causes the 20 kg mass to accelerate at:<br>\(a=\frac{150N}{20kg}=7.5m/s^2\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 3</strong></span><br>Place a 10 kg mass on a frictionless 35 degree incline plane, and attach a<br>second 20 kg mass via a cord to hang vertically. Calculate the acceleration of<br>the system.<br><br>Solution:<br>\(mg = 98N\)<br>\(98N*sin35 = 56N\)<br>\(98N*cos35 = 80N\)<br><br>Mass 1 is 10 kg at 35 degree down incline plane.<br>Mass 2 is 20 kg and hangs straight down. It has a downward force of 196N.<br>This problem introduces the concept of the tension in the connecting cord. The<br>most convenient way to visualize this tension is that if the cord were cut and a<br>force meter inserted, it would read a certain tension(force). This tension acts<br>on each mass. Notice the 35 degree angle between the normal and the direction of<br>mg. <br><br>To write equations relating the unbalanced force to the acceleration, we need to<br>make an assumption as to which way the masses move. Assume that the system moves<br>to the right or clockwise. <br><br>Start by writing equations relating the unbalanced force on each mass. On m1,<br>the unbalanced force is T-56N, and this force makes the 10 kg accelerate.<br>\(T-56N = 10kg*a\)<br>Likewise on mass2, the unbalanced force to make the mass accelerate is:<br>\(196N-T = 20kg*a\)<br><br>The assumption that that system accelerates clockwise dictates the directions of<br>the forces in these two equations. Look again at these equations, and notice<br>that if we had assumed the acceleration were counterclockwise, then the signs<br>would be different. In frictionless problems it is alright to have a negative<br>acceleration. The negative sign means that you guessed wrong in assuming the<br>acceleration direction. This is not true with friction problems. Add the two<br>equations, and take the acceleration as the same. The accelerations are the same<br>because the masses are linked together with the cord.<br>\(140N = 30kg * a | a = 4.7m/s^2\)<br><br>Now the tension in the cord is easily calculated from the equation for mass 1.<br>\(T = 56N + 10kg * 4.7m/s^2 = 103N\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 4</strong></span><br>The next complication in force problems with inclined planes is a double<br>inclined plane.<br><br>Mass 1 is 12 kg going down to the left of the apex at a 40 degree angle.<br>Mass 2 is 20 kg going down to the right of the apex at a 25 degree angle.<br><br>Solution: Create a vector diagram, it is helpful. <br>Assume the system moves clockwise.<br><br>We will start with mass 1 first.<br>The force straight down is 118 N, from (12 kg * 9.8 m/s^2).<br>Now, lets calculate the force down the incline plane to the left.<br>118 N * sin 40 = 76 N<br><br>Now, lets go to mass 2.<br>The force straight down is 196 N, from (20 kg * 9.8 m/s^2).<br>Now, lets calculate the force down the incline plane to the right.<br>196 N * sin 25 = 83 N<br><br>The equation for mass 1 is: T-76N = 12 kg * a<br>The equation for mass 2 is: 83N-T = 20 kg * a<br>Add the two equations<br>7.0N = 32 kg * a<br>a = 0.22 m/s^2<br>The tension in the cord is:<br>T = 76N + 12 kg * 0.22 m/s^2 = 79 N<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 5</strong></span><br>Another popular problem is the Atwood machine. Find the acceleration of the<br>system. <br><br>Solution: Assume that the system moves counterclockwise. <br>The equation for mass 1 is 98N-T = 10kg * a<br>The equation for mass 2 is T-147N = 15kg * a<br>Add the two equations<br>-49N = 25kg * a<br>a = -2.0 m/s^2<br>Force of mass 1 is 10kg * 9.8 m/s^2 = 98N<br>Force of mass 2 is 15kg * 9.8 m/s^2 = 147N<br>The system accelerates clockwise. The tension in the cord is from the equation<br>for mass 1.<br>T = 98N + 10kg * 2.0m/s^2 = 118N<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Friction</strong></span><br>A good first problem in friction is where the problem is first done without<br>friction and then with friction.<br><br>For the purposes of doing problems, there are two important properties of<br>frictional forces:<br> They oppose the motion<br> They are less than or equal to a constant (coefficient of friction), times the<br> normal force, the force at the frictioning surface.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 6</strong></span><br>Two masses are arranged with one, of 50kg, on a frictionless table and the<br>other, of 30 kg, attached by a cord and hanging, over a frictionless pulley, off<br>the edge of a table. Find the acceleration of the system.<br><br>Solution: Assume that the system moves clockwise. <br>The equation for mass 1 is T=50kg * a<br>The equation for mass 2 is 294N-T = 30kg * a<br>Add the two equations:<br>294N = 80kg * a<br>a = 3.7 m/s^2<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 7</strong></span><br>For the situation in Example 6, add a coefficient of friction \mu=.20 between<br>the block and the table.<br><br>Solution:<br>As above, horizontal:<br>\mu N = mu*m*g = 0.20*50kg*9.8m/s^2 = 98N<br>Vertical:<br>294N<br>The equation for mass 1 is T-98N=50kg*a<br>The equation for mass 2 is 294N-T=30kg*a<br>Add the equations:<br>196N=80kg*a<br>a=2.4m/s^2<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 8</strong></span><br>For the situation in the previous problem, increase the coefficient of friction<br>to 0.80. What is the acceleration of the system?<br><br>Solution: <br>\(f=\mu N=\mu*m*g=0.80*50kg*9,8m/s^2=392N\)<br>\(294N\)<br>The equation for mass 1 is \(T-392N=50kg*a\)<br>The equation for mass 2 is \(294-T=30kg*a\)<br>Add the two equations<br>\(-98N=80kg*a\)<br>\(a=-1.2m/s^2\)<br><br>Clearly, the system does not accelerate counterclockwise. This is an<br>illustration of the second property of frictional forces: the frictional force<br>is less than or equal to \(\mu N\). In this case the frictional force just<br>balances the tension in the cord. The frictional force can be up to 392N. In<br>order for mass 2 not to move, the tension in the cord must be 294N. If mass 2 is<br>not moving, the forces must be in balance. Therefore, the forces on mass 1 must<br>be 294N due to the tension in the cord and 294N due to friction. <br><br>Another important point with frictional forces is the minimal force.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 9</strong></span><br>A 50kg sled is pulled along a level surface at constant velocity by a constant<br>force of 200N at an angle of 30 degrees. What is the coefficient of friction<br>between the sled and the surface?<br><br>Solution: The first step in this problem is to find the components of the<br>applied force and the mg of the sled. These are shown in the vector diagram.<br>Notice the normal force, the actual force between the sled and the friction<br>surface, is mg minus the component of the applied force lifting up the sled.<br>Sometimes it is easy to miss this vertical component of the applied force. This<br>is a major mistake in this type of problem. To help visualize this vertical<br>component of force, try placing the origin for the vectors in the middle of the<br>sled rather than at one end, where a rope would be attached.<br><br>\(f = \mu*N\)<br>\(mg = 50kg*9.8m/s^2 = 490N\)<br>\(200N * sin 30 = 100N\)<br>\(200N * cos 30 = 173N\)<br><br>The normal force is mg minus the vertical component of the applied force, 100N,<br>or 390N total. Since the sled is moving at constant velocity, the forces must be<br>in equilibrium. The horizontal component of the applied force must equal the<br>frictional retarding force, the coefficient of friction times the normal force.<br>\(\mu*390N = 173N\)<br>\(\mu = 0.44\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 10</strong></span><br>A 65 degree inclined plane has a mass of 20kg on the plane where the coefficient<br>of friction is 0.40 and a mass of 50kg hanging free. Calculate the acceleration<br>of the system.<br><br>Solution: Setup the vector diagram assuming that the motion is counterclockwise.<br>In the diagram, the frictional force is calculated as a maximum of 33N.<br><br>The equation for mass2 is \(490N-T=50kg*a\)<br>The equation for mass1 is \(T-178N=50kg*a\)<br>Add the equations: \(279N=70kg*a\)<br>\(a=4.0m/s^2\)<br><br>\(mg = 50kg*9.8m/s^2 = 490N\)<br>Mass2 of 50kg is hanging straight down off a pulley.<br>Mass1 of 20kg is sliding down an incline plane. The plane is a 65 degree angle.<br>Coefficient of friction is 0.40<br>\(196N cos65=83N\)<br>\(196N sin65=178N\)<br>\(0.40*83N=33N\)<br><br>In doing friction problems like this, you have to be careful with the frictional<br>force. If the forces up and down the plane are nearly balanced, it is important<br>to remember that the frictional force is not 33N but that it can be up to 33N.<br>In a problem similar tot his, it could easily happen that the blocks would not<br>move.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 11</strong></span><br>Consider a double inclined plane with angles, masses, and coefficients of<br>friction as shown. Calculate the acceleration of the system.<br><br>You have a sort of triangle with the apex at the top. To the left and right of<br>the apex are inclined planes. On the left inclined plane, you have mass1 of<br>6.0kg, coefficient of friction of 0.30, and going down at an angle of 30<br>degrees. <br><br>On the right inclined plane, you have mass2 of 9.0kg, coefficient of friction of<br>0.16, and sliding down at an angle of 45 degrees.<br><br>Solution: Assume that the system moves counterclockwise, and set up the vector<br>diagram.<br>The equation for mass1 is \((30-15-T)N=6.0kg*a\)<br>The equation for mass2 is \((T-62-10)N=9.0kg*a\)<br>Add the equations \(-57N=15kg*a\)<br><br>\(59N sin30=30N\)<br>\(59N cos30=51N\)<br>\(f=0.30*51N=15N\)<br><br>\(88N sin45=62N\)<br>\(88N cos45=62N\)<br>\(f=0.16*62N=10N\)<br><br>This is a negative acceleration. We cannot simply reverse the sign of "a" to<br>find the correct answer because if the system were moving the other way, the<br>frictional forces would have to be reversed. further analysis requires us to<br>consider another vector diagram assuming that the system moves in a clockwise<br>direction. <br><br>The new equations are \((T-30-15)N=6.0kg*a\)<br>\((62-T-10)N=9.0kg*a\)<br>Add the equations: \(7.0N=15kg*a\)<br>\(a=0.54m/s^2\)<br><br>The tension in the cord is from the first equation:<br>\(T=45N+6.0kg*0.54m/s^2)=48N\)<br><br>If the acceleration of the system were negative for both the clockwise and<br>counterclockwise calculations, then we would conclude that the system would not<br>move.<br><br>The final complication in these inclined plane problems is the introduction of<br>three masses and two connecting rods.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 12</strong></span><br>Consider a flat surface with a coefficient of friction of 0.20 with a 2.0kg mass<br>and a 3kg mass connected together with a 6kg mass along a slant as shown. The<br>coefficient of friction on the slant is 0. The slant is going down at an angle<br>of 25 degrees. Calculate the acceleration of the system. <br><br>Solution:<br>In this problem, note that the tensions are different, leading to 3 unknowns,<br>T1, T2, and a. The solution will require three equations from three vector<br>diagrams.

There is an acceleration and a force associated with such a particle. <br><br>While the length of the velocity vector remains the same, the direction changes<br>continually.

What<br>is the maximum speed for this car driven in a circle of 160m radius. <br><br>Solution:<br>A side force of 0.95g means a side force or acceleration directed at right<br>angles to the direction of travel of 0.95*9.8=9.3m/s^2.

The normal force(between the car and the road) is<br>normal to the surface, with the vertical component equal to mg and the<br>horizontal component equal to \(mv^2/r\).<br>We have: \(N cos 20 = mg\) and \(N sin 20 = mv^2/r\)<br>Then: \(\frac{N sin 20}{N cos 20} = tan 20 = \frac{v^2}{rg} \)<br>So: \(v = \sqrt{rg tan 20} = \sqrt{240m*9.8*tan 20} = 29m/s \)<br>Notice that in this problem the mass of the car does not enter into the<br>calculation.<br><br>Go back over problems 13-18 and notice how each problem could be written asking<br>for a different variable. For example, in problem 13, give the side force and<br>the velocity, and ask for the radius. In problem 16, give the speed and the<br>coefficient of friction, and ask for the radius. Changing the problems like this<br>is an excellent way to generate practice problems.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 19</strong></span><br>A 2kg ball is whirled in a vertical circle of radius 1m at a constant velocity<br>of 6.28m/s. Calculate the tension in the cord at the top of the motion, the<br>tension in the cord at the bottom of the motion, and the minimum velocity to<br>keep the mass from falling out at the top of the circle. <br><br>Solution:<br>We are considering this problem from the reference frame of the ball, not from<br>the point of view of the person whirling the ball. From the person's point of<br>view, the tension is pulling radially outward. From the ball's referencew frame,<br>the tension is radially inward. If the ball is to move in a circle, this must be<br>the case. There must be a net center directed force. <br><br>Operationally, a good method for solving centripetal force problems is to find<br>the net center directed force and set this equal to \(mv^2/r\).<br>\(T+mg=\frac{mv^2}{r}\)<br>\(T=\frac{mv^2}{r}-mg\)<br>\(T=\frac{2.0kg*6,28m/s^2}{1.0m} - 2.0kg(9.8m/s^2)=59.4N\)<br><br>\(T-mg=\frac{mv^2}{r}\)<br>\(T=\frac{mv^2}{r}+mg\)<br>\(T=\frac{2.0kg*6.28m/s^2}{1.0m} + 2.9kg*9.8m/s^2 = 98.6N\)<br><br>For part c, the minimum velocity required can be found by considering the<br>condition where mv^2 is less than or equal mg. In this case, at the top of the<br>motion, the mass will fall out of the loop. So let's set the two forces equal<br>and solve for the minimum velocity needed to keep the mass in the loop.<br>\(\frac{mv^2_{min}}{r} = mg \rightarrow v_{min} = \sqrt{rg} =<br>\sqrt{1.0m*9.8}=3.13m/s\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 20</strong></span><br>A person on a dirt bike travels over a semicircular shaped bridge with a radius<br>of curvature of 45m. Calculate the max speed of the bike if its road wheels are<br>to stay in contact with the bridge. <br><br>Solution:<br>Again, let us find the net center directed force and set this equal to<br>\(mv^2/r\). So: \(mg-R=\frac{mv^2}{r}\) and: \(R=mg-\frac{mv^2}{r}\).<br>As v increases, R must decrease because mg is constant. In the limiting case,<br>when the wheels are just about to leave the ground, R=0, so<br>\(mg=\frac{mv^2}{r}\).<br>The mass m cancels out and is not required. So max speed v is given by<br>\(v^2=rg\).<br>Plugging in the numbers: \(v=\sqrt{rg} = \sqrt{441} = 21m/s\)<br><br>At this point, you might be thinking that from the point of view of the person<br>on the dirt bike, the \(mv^2/r\) force is radially outward. The rider is<br>momentarily weightless as the wheels leave the ground. This is correct- from the<br>reference frame of the person inside the circular motion. Astronauts in the<br>space station orbiting Earth are weightless. To them, there is no net force, and<br>the effect of the \(mv^2/r\) force is radially outward to counterbalance<br>gravity.<br><br>If you go around a corner in a car, you seem to feel a force outward from the<br>circle, not inward. But from the reference frame of a stationary observer, there<br>must be a net center directed force on both the astronaut(gravity) and the<br>person toward the center of the circle; otherwise, the person could not be<br>moving in a circle. Is one force correct and the other incorrect? Is either of<br>these an illusion? No, they are all real forces.<br><br>Take a thoughtful trip in an airplane flying in a horizontal circle with its<br>wings vertical. The force acting on you is toward the center of the circle, but<br>you exert an equal and opposite force on the seat that is radially out of the<br>circle. In some airplanes, if the banking is done too hard, this radially<br>outward force can be so great as to the blood in the pilot to remain in the<br>lower part of the body, resulting in a loss of oxygen to the brain and what is<br>called a blackout. So the blackout is the result of a radially outward force.<br><br>Is one reference frame correct and the other incorrect? When you study<br>Einstein's theory or relativity in physics, you will come across the idea that<br>there is no one absolute reference frame. You may think that a reference frame<br>at rest relative to the ground is correct, but the Earth spins on its axis and<br>rotates around the Sun. The Sun moves around the galactic center. In relativity,<br>we always have to specify the reference frame we are considering. And the<br>observed effects of many things change depending on the chosen reference frame. <br><br>So, when doing circular motion problems, always think about what reference<br>frame you are considering. For the method in the preceding problem, our<br>reference frame is outside the motion, and in this perspective, we take the net<br>center directed force and set it equal to \(mv^2/r\). This is the default<br>reference frame that is commonly used to solve circular motion problems. </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 29, 2024</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/physics/">Physics</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fforces-in-physics.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fforces-in-physics.html&amp;via=Science%20By%20Jason&amp;text=Forces%20In%20Physics" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/functions-and-notation-in-precalculus.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Functions and Notation in Precalculus</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/domain-and-range-in-precalculus.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Domain and Range in Precalculus </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-07-10T18:03" class="feed__date">July 10, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/projectile-motion-in-physics.html" class="invert">Projectile Motion In Physics</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-05-13T18:47" class="feed__date">May 13, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/falling-body-problems-in-physics.html" class="invert">Falling Body Problems in Physics</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-04-12T18:20" class="feed__date">April 12, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/kinematics-in-physics.html" class="invert">Kinematics in Physics</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></script></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Jason Moore 2021</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
