These problems are where the constant acceleration is the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Earth. I will list them here.</span></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v_{avg} = \frac{v+v_{0}}{2}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v = v_{0} + at\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[x - x_{0} = (½)(v + v_{0})t\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[x - x_{0} = v_{0}t + (½)at^{2}\]</span></p><p>\[v^{2} = v_{o}^{2} + 2a(x - x_{o})\]</p><p> </p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 1</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider a ball dropped from the top of a 40 m tall building. Calculate everything possible.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will not be able to calculate everything at first.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trick is to calculate what you can and those answers will lead you to the rest of the calculations.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">displacement=40 meters</span></p><p>\[x=0\text{  } v_{o}=0\text{  } a=9.8m/s^{2}\]</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since most of the kinematic equations contain the time, this is usually one of the first things to calculate.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the equation that has all the variables included in it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[x-x_{0}=v^{2}_{0}t+(½)at^{2}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[40m = (½)(9.8m/s^{2})t{2}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[= 2.9s\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing the time, we can calculate the velocity using the second equation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v = v_{0} + at\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v = 0 + 9.8m/s^{2}(2.9)\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[= 28m/s\]</span></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 2</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, using the original problem, let us add an initial velocity of 8.0m/s when the ball is thrown down instead of just dropped. Find the time for the ball to reach the ground and the velocity on impact. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, we calculate the time for the ball to hit the ground as before.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[x - x_{0} = v_{0}t + (½)at^{2}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[40m = 8.0t + (½)(9.8t^{2}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[40m = 8.0t + 4.9t^{2}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[4.9t^{2} + 8.0t - 40m = 0\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use a quadratic formula.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[t = \frac{-80\pm\sqrt{64-4(4.9)(-40)}}{2(4.9)}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[t = 2.2s\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The velocity at the ground level is:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v^{2} = (8.0m/s^{2})^{2} + 2(9.8m/s^{2})(40m) = 848m^{2}s^{2} = 29m/s\]</span></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 3</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the first problem, now throw the ball up from the top of the building with a velocity of 8.0 m/s. Find the time for the ball to reach the ground and the velocity on impact.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take x as the displacement as positive down and the velocity as negative up. It is important to remember that the sign of the velocity is opposite that of the displacement. It does not matter whether the velocity is negative and the distance down is positive, only that they are opposite. Calculate the time of flight.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[40m = (-8.0m/s)t + (4.9m/s^{2})t^{2}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[4.9t^{2} - 8.0t - 40 = 0\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[t = \frac{8.0\pm\sqrt{64-4(4.9)(-40)}}{9.8} = 3.8s\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The positive time is the correct choice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The velocity when the ball strikes the ground is:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v^{2} = (-8.0m/s^{2}) + 2(9.8m/s^{2})40m = 848m^{2}/s^{2} = 29m/s\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notice that whether the v term is a positive number or negative number, the result is the same. If the ball is thrown up with a certain velocity or down with the same velocity, the velocity at impact is the same. This is to be expected from the symmetry of the equations. If the ball is thrown up with a certain velocity, then on the way down it passes the same level with that same velocity.</span></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 4</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the situation in the above problem, calculate the maximum height above the top of the building and the time for the ball to reach maximum height.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time for the ball to reach maximum height is from equation 2. Note that at maximum height, the velocity must be zero. Watch the signs closely. It does not matter how you choose the signs, but the acceleration has to be opposite the velocity. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v = v_{0} + at\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[0 = 8.0m/s - (9.8m/s^{2})\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[t = 0.82s\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the symmetry, it takes the ball the same amount of time to reach maximum height as it does for the ball to return to the original level.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calculate the height above the top of the building from equation 5.</span></p><p>\[v^{2} = v_{o}^{2} + 2a(x - x_{o})\]</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[0^{2} = (8.0m/s^{2}) - 2(9.8m/s^{2})(x - x_{0}) = 3.3m\]</span></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 5</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bottle of champagne is dropped by a balloonist. The balloon is rising at a constant velocity of 3.0 m/s. It takes 8.0 s for the bottle of champagne to reach the ground. Find the height of the balloon when the bottle was dropped, the height of the balloon when the bottle reached the ground, and the velocity with which the bottle strikes the ground. </span></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several possibilities  concerning the origin and direction of the coordinate system. Take the origin at the height of the balloon when the bottle is dropped and the position of the balloon at t=0. Take the displacement as positive down. The main reason for taking the displacement as positive down is that the acceleration is down and the initial velocity is up, making two positives and one negative. As time goes on, displacement, velocity, and acceleration will be positive. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, write the equation for the height of the balloon starting from the time when the bottle is dropped.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[x = (-3.0m/s)t + (4.9m/s^{2})t^{2} = (-3.0m/s)(8.0s) + (4.9m/s^{2})(64s^{2}) = 290m\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The height of the balloon when the bottle  was dropped plus the amount  the balloon rose in the 8.0s it took the bottle to reach the ground:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[290m + (3.0m/s)8.0s = 314m\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The velocity on impact :</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v = v_{0} + at = -3.0m/s + (9.8m/s^{2})(8.0s) = 75m/s\]</span></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 6</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A parachutist descending at a constant rate of 2.0 m/s drops a smoke canister at a height of 300m. Find the time for the smoke canister to reach the ground and its velocity when it strikes the ground. Then find the time for the parachutist to reach the ground, the position of the parachutist when the smoke canister strikes the ground, and an expression for the distance between the smoke canister and the parachutist. </span></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time for the smoke canister to reach the ground is from equation 4.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[x = v_{0}t + (½)at^{2}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[300m = (2.0m/s)t + (4.9m/s^{2})t^{2}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without units, the equation is \(4.9t^{2} + 2.0t - 300 = 0\) with solutions.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[t = \frac{-2\pm\sqrt{4-4(4.9)(-300)}}{2*4.9}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[= \frac{-2\pm76.7}{9.8} = 7.6\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time for the canister to hit the ground is 7.6s. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The velocity when it strikes the ground is:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v^{2} = (2.0m/s)^{2} + 2(9.8m/s^{2})300m = 5884m^{2}/s^{2}= 77m/s\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time for the parachutist to reach the ground is from equation 3.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[300m = (2.0m/s)t = 150s\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the canister strikes the ground, the parachutist has dropped:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[(2.0m/s)7.6 = 15m\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And is 285 m above the ground. The expression for the distance between the canister and the parachutist is:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[x_{c} - x_{p} = (2.0m/s)t + (4.9m/s^{2})t^{2} - (2.0m/s)t = (4.9m/s^{2})t^{2}\]</span></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 7</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A coconut is dropped from a height of 60m. One second later, a second coconut is thrown down with an initial velocity. Both coconuts reach the ground at the same time. What was the initial velocity of the second coconut?</span></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In problems where there is a time delay, it is usually best to calculate the position, velocity, and acceleration of the first particle at the time when the second particle starts to move. It is possible to do time delay problems with a time differential in one set of equations. The difficulty with this approach is that it is easy to get an algebraic sign wrong. If you say that the time for the second particle is the time for the first particle plus the difference between them, then it is essential that the algebraic sign of the difference be correct. It is much easier to do them, in this slower but inherently more accurate way. First, calculate the state of the first particle when the second one begins moving. Then write the two sets of equations describing the motion with this instant as t=0.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calculate the position and velocity of the first coconut at the end of 1s, the time when the second one starts.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[x = (½)at^{2} = (½)(9.8m/s^{2})(1.0s)^{2} = 4.9m\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v = at = 9.8m/s^{2}(1.0s) = 9.8m/s\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since position, velocity, and acceleration is positive down, orient the coordinate system for positive down with the origin at the top. At the instant the second coconut is thrown down, the first coconut has position 4.9m, velocity 9.8m/s and acceleration 9.8m/s^{2}.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since both coconuts strike the ground at the same time, use the conditions of the first coconut to find the total time. First, calculate the velocity at impact of the first coconut.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v_{1}^{2} = v_{1o}^{2} + 2a(x_{1}-x_{1o}) = (9.8m/s)^{2} + 2(9.8m/s^{2})(60-4.9)m = 1176m^{2}/s^{2} = 34.3m/s\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time for the second coconut to reach the ground is the same as the time for the first coconut to go from 4.9 m to 60 m or the time for the first coconut to go from 9.8 m/s to 34.3 m/s.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comes from \(v = v_{0} + at\) where the velocity of the first coconut when the second one is thrown down, and v is the velocity of the first coconut at the ground.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[34.3m/s = 9.8 m/s _ (9.8m/s^{2})t = 2.5s\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we have the time for the second coconut to travel the 60 m, we can find its initial velocity from \(x-x_{0}=v_{2o}t + (½)at^{2}\) where t is the total time for the second coconut.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[60m = v_{2o}(2.5s) + (4.9m/s^{2}(2.5s)^{2} =11.75m/s\]</span></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 8</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A boat is passing under a bridge. The deck of the boat is 15 m below the bridge. A small package is to be dropped from the bridge onto the deck of the boat when the boat is 25 m from just below the drop point. What boat speed is necessary to have the package land in the boat?</span></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calculate the time for the package to fall the 15.0 m using \(x-x_{0} = v_{o}t+(½)at^{2}\)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[15m = (4.9m/s^{2})t^{2} = 1.7s\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The boat must move forward at 25 m/ 1.7s = 14 m/s.</span></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 9</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are observing steel balls falling at a constant velocity in a liquid filled tank. The window you are using is 1m high, and the bottom of the window is 12m from the bottom of the tank. You observe a ball falling past the window taking 3.0s to pass the window. Calculate the time required to reach the bottom of the tank after the ball has reached the bottom of the window.</span></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The observed velocity is \(1.0m/3.0s so 12 m = (1.0m/3.0st = 36s\)</span></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 10</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a situation similar to the last example, the tank is filled with a different liquid, causing the acceleration in the tank to be \(6.0 m/s^{2}\) and the time to traverse the window .40 s. Calculate the height of the liquid above the window, the time to reach the bottom of the tank, and the velocity of the ball when it reaches the bottom of the tank. </span></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the data about the window, calculate the velocity of the ball at the top of the window.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[x-x_{o} = v_{t}t + (½)at^{2}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[1.0m = v_{t}(.40s) + (3.0m/s^{2})(.40s)^{2} = 1.3m/s\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The velocity at the bottom of the window is from:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v_{b}^{2} = v_{t}^{2} + 2a(x-x_{o}) = (1.3m/s)^{2} + 2(6.0m/s^{2})1.0m = 3.7m/s\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time to reach the bottom of the tank is from \(x-x_{o} = v_{b}t + (½)at^{2}\)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[12m = (3.7m/s)t + (3.0m/s^{2})t^{2}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eliminate the units</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[t = \frac{-3.7\pm \sqrt{(3.7)^{2} - 4(3.0)(-12)}}{2(3)} = \frac{-3.7\pm12.6}{6} = 1.5\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This positive time is for the ball to travel from the bottom of the window to the bottom of the tank.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assuming that the ball started at zero velocity, the distance from the top of the liquid to the top of the window will come from \(v_{t}^{2}=v_{o}^{2}+2ax_{t}\)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[(1.3m/s)^{2} = 2(6.0m/s)x_{t} = .14m\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The velocity with which the ball strikes the bottom of the tank is:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v = v_{b} + at = (3.7m/s) + (6.0m/s^{2})1.5s = 12.7m/s\]</span></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 11</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A ball is observed to pass a 1.4m tall window going up and later going down. The total observation time is .40s(.20s going up and .20s going down). How high does the ball rise above the window?</span></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is another example of a question that seems totally unrelated to the information in the problem. When you don’t know where to start and you do not see a clear path to the desired answer, simply start where you can, calculating what you can and hopefully learning enough to answer the specific question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first things we can calculate in this problem is the average velocity at the middle of the window.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v_{avg} = (1.4m/2.0s) = 7.0m/s\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This average velocity is the velocity of the ball on the way up and on the way down at the middle of the window. Add this feature to the problem. With this information, we can use \(v^{2} = v_{o}^{2} + 2ax_{t}\) to find the distance the ball rises above the midpoint of the window.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[(7.0m/s)^{2} = 2(9.8m/s^{2})x_{t} = 2.5m\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the ball rises 2.5-0.7=18 m above the top of the window.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">View the ball as decelerating as it goes up past the window, ands find \(v_{b}\) at the bottom of the window from \(x-x_{o}=v_{o}t+(½)at^{2}\).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[1.4m = v_{b}(.20s)-(4.9m/s^{2})(.20s)^{2} = 8.0m/s\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Velocity and displacement are taken as positive, so acceleration is negative.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the distance to maximum height, where velocity is zero, is:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[(8.0m/s)^{2} = 2(9.8m/s^{2})x_{m} = 3.2m\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, the maximum height of the ball above the top of the window is 3.2 m - 1.4 m = 1.8m.</span></p><p><strong><br><br><br><br><br></strong></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 29, 2024</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/physics/">Physics</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Ffalling-body-problems-in-physics.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Ffalling-body-problems-in-physics.html&amp;via=Science%20By%20Jason&amp;text=Falling%20Body%20Problems%20in%20Physics" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/an-introduction-to-french.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> An Introduction to French</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/what-is-statistics.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> What Is Statistics </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-07-26T19:36" class="feed__date">July 26, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/forces-in-physics.html" class="invert">Forces In Physics</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-07-10T18:03" class="feed__date">July 10, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/projectile-motion-in-physics.html" class="invert">Projectile Motion In Physics</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-04-12T18:20" class="feed__date">April 12, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/kinematics-in-physics.html" class="invert">Kinematics in Physics</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></script></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Jason Moore 2021</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
