Its speed is always the same.</p><p id="8c54" class="id ie gi if b ig jy ih ii ij jz ik il im ka in io ip kb iq ir is kc it iu iw do ef" data-selectable-paragraph="">This is important because it allows us to measure distances to other things in space.

So let’s get going and restore some order to our night skies.</p><p>The most important concept that we need to talk about is gravity. It is the reason for being. It is the key to it all.</p><p>Let me say right here that I am discussing the original interpretation of gravity and not <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Einstein’s</a></em> curvature of spacetime.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8bfj6ih6d" class="align-center"><strong>Planetary Motion</strong></h3><p> </p><p>Let us start with <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tycho Brahe</a></em>. He was a Danish astronomer who observed the motion of celestial bodies for many years. He recorded all of his data. This data was essential to Johannes Kepler and his eventual laws of planetary motion. His laws of planetary motion catapulted modern science forward.</p><p>A planet such as our Earth, Mars, or Venus moves in an orbit. An orbit is the path it takes. Astronomers first thought the orbits of planets were big circles, but they soon discovered it was something else entirely. Planets just disappeared. They disappeared because scientists at the time were looking in a circular path.

Kepler, however, soon found out that planets moved in an elliptical shape. He did not know why.</p><p>We can describe an elliptical as an irregular circle. There is not any definite shape to an elliptical because its lengths can vary. I can call any of the lengths an elliptical. The center of the elliptical to the longest side is called the semi-major axis. It is half the length of the diameter.</p><p>The eccentricity of the ellipse is also important. It is a measure of how circular or non-circular an ellipse is. We calculate it using a ratio of the distance between the foci to the length of the major axis. You can think of it as a triangle. You have the center of the ellipse, the foci in one direction, and then the major axis at the other end.</p><p>An eccentricity of 0 means the shape is perfectly circular. As eccentricity approaches 1, it is very elliptical. If eccentricity is over one the object is probably not orbiting the center of the ellipse at all.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8bfj6ih6f" class="align-center"><strong>Newton’s Laws</strong></h3><p> </p><p>This leads us to Newton’s laws. He was famous for his three laws, and they had a tremendous impact on the scientific world.</p><ol><li><p>First Law = Every object continues to be in the same state of moving or non-moving and at a constant speed in a straight line unless another force changes this.</p></li><li><p>Second Law = The change of motion of an object is proportional to and in the force's direction acting upon it.</p></li><li><p>Third Law = For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</p></li></ol><p>These laws are pretty straightforward. However, let me explain to anyone that might not be familiar with them.</p><p>The first law says that objects will stay at rest or continue in the same line of motion unless some external force acts upon it. An example of a force that would change it could be friction or another object striking it. In either of these two cases, the original object would experience some change of motion or direction.</p><p>The second law is a little more vague. In a vacuum, this is what happens. However, hardly anything is in a vacuum, though space can sometimes be close. If you neglect friction, a pool ball can change its course to match perfectly the direction that another ball strikes it. The original pool ball will have the same direction and velocity as the one that hit it. Keep in mind, this is a vacuum instance we are talking about.</p><p>I think the third law of<em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newton</a></em> was his most profound. If you think about it, it is true whether or not in a vacuum. The reason it is so important is that it implies their forces do not act alone. If there is an equal and opposite reaction, that means there are multiple forces at play.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8bfj6ih6g" class="align-center"><strong>Momentum</strong></h3><p> </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/56/Ang_mom_2d.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/56/responsive/Ang_mom_2d-xs.png 300w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/56/responsive/Ang_mom_2d-sm.png 480w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/56/responsive/Ang_mom_2d-md.png 768w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/56/responsive/Ang_mom_2d-lg.png 1024w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/56/responsive/Ang_mom_2d-xl.png 1360w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/56/responsive/Ang_mom_2d-2xl.png 1600w" alt="r 	Tfr000" width="512" height="500"></figure><p> </p><p>This brings us to the next concept that is important in understanding orbital motion, which is momentum. Specifically, I am talking about angular momentum. Let us use planets as example pieces. Angular momentum is its rotation as it revolves around the Sun. It is calculated by multiplying together its mass, velocity, and the square of its radius.</p><p>Another factor that Newton’s third law is talking about, is that momentum must be conserved. This is the equation for angular momentum.</p><p>\[angular momentum \propto mass * rotation * radius^2 \]</p><p>You can see that mass is involved and that will become more important later on. This is because we must conserve linear and angular momentum at all times. So, with any change to the object, the properties just shift so that the momentum is conserved.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8bfj6ih6h" class="align-center"><strong>Gravity’s Effect</strong></h3><p> </p><p>Now we come to the culmination of our previous concepts. We talked about a force would have to affect any object in order for it to change its velocity. In space, this force is usually gravity. Gravity affects everything. It’s affect depends on the mass and distance of the objects in question.</p><p>Gravity is the reason the Earth and the other planets orbit around the Sun. The Sun is so massive that it influences everything in the solar system. All the celestial objects that include planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and gas clouds are all controlled by our Sun. This is what almost all <em><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/the-evolution-of-stars.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stars</a></em> do throughout the universe.</p><p>The equation that lets us calculate the force of gravity on certain objects is:</p><p>\[ F_gravity = G\frac{M_1*M_2}{R^2}\]</p><p>This tells us the gravitational force between these two objects. R is the distance between these objects. G is the famous gravitational constant.</p><p>Gravitational attraction affects all forms of mass. Since nearly everything has mass, it is ubiquitous. The more mass an object has, the more gravitational force it applies.</p><p>Gravity gets weaker with distance, no matter the mass of the original object. However, if the distance is far enough away, the effect is minimal and not really noticeable. That is just the nature of mass and gravity.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f8bfj6ih6i" class="align-center"><strong>Asteroids And Comets</strong></h3><p> </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/56/asteroid.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/56/responsive/asteroid-xs.jpg 300w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/56/responsive/asteroid-sm.jpg 480w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/56/responsive/asteroid-md.jpg 768w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/56/responsive/asteroid-lg.jpg 1024w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/56/responsive/asteroid-xl.jpg 1360w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/56/responsive/asteroid-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt=" Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/UCLA/MPS/DLR/IDA " width="673" height="659"></figure><p> </p><p>There is an abundance of asteroids and comets in our galaxy.

Most travel around the asteroid belt. The asteroid belt is a band of rocks(not a rock band) that orbits the Sun.

There are countless objects wandering around out there. We have learned much from even the smallest things like dust in space. The Solar System is a very complicated and busy place. To learn, we measure everything we can and then compare constantly. That is the fun of it to me. I love looking at data and seeing how objects are different. Our resident star, the Sun, is the dominant force in the solar system.</p><p>The area that our sun has control over is collectively known as the Solar System.

What is the mass of this planet versus the mass of this other one? To do that, we have to observe characteristics and take measurements in whatever way we can in order to build a profile about planets and everything else. Some of these characteristics are brightness, density, mass, composition, distance from host star, orbits, and many other details.</p><p>By doing this, we can logically conclude that two objects with roughly the same attributes were made the same way. This is the foundation of our experiments and theory and very important. </p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f9rnt34d86m" class="align-center"><strong>How Does Observing The Galaxy Help Us</strong></h3><p> </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/59/solar-system-1.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/59/responsive/solar-system-1-xs.jpg 300w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/59/responsive/solar-system-1-sm.jpg 480w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/59/responsive/solar-system-1-md.jpg 768w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/59/responsive/solar-system-1-lg.jpg 1024w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/59/responsive/solar-system-1-xl.jpg 1360w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/59/responsive/solar-system-1-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1600" height="900"><figcaption><cite class="Text-module__typo___2-LMx Text-module__caption-1___EYH0z Images-module__ImageDrawerLink___2mwDa" data-testid="imageDrawerLink">solarsystem.nasa.gov</cite></figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>This might seem like a strange question. I mean, most people would say it is a good idea to observe. But, how does it help us? When I first encountered this question in school, I really could not come up with an answer that satisfied me.</p><p>On homework I just put something generic. I am coming back to it now because I feel it is important and wanted to help others who might have had the same issue.</p><p>As we observe stars, planets, or comets in our night sky, we measure everything that we can. Things like how bright does it appear or maybe how fast does it move across the sky. We start with basics just to start somewhere.</p><p>After we do that for a while, we get an idea for how things work. It may not be a deep idea yet, but it’s there and it takes hold. When we observe other Solar Systems, we get to test those ideas and see if they hold true to these faraway objects.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f9rnt34d86n" class="align-center"><strong>Size Of Our Solar System Objects</strong></h3><p> </p><p>The size of our Solar System objects varies. The largest mass in the solar system is our Sun. It is also by far the largest thing out there besides other stars. The Sun is 99% of our galaxy, if you measure by mass.</p><p>The largest planets are Jupiter and Saturn. They are many times the size of our Earth. The smallest planets are Mercury and Venus. Venus is about 80% the size of Earth but Mercury is only around 40% of our radius.</p><p>Moons are much smaller than planets. Our moon approaches the size of some of the smaller planets, but others are much smaller. Asteroids are much smaller still.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f9rnt34d86o" class="align-center"><strong>Types Of Measurements</strong></h3><p> </p><p>As mentioned earlier, there are many attributes that we can measure about the objects in the solar system.

How do we go about this though? Geometry is key to this. Specifically, the use of triangles and their properties. We can learn much using these simple tools. If possible, we even directly observe any moons, asteroids, or planets that we come across.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f9rnt34d86q" class="align-center"><strong>Distances In Our Solar System</strong></h3><p> </p><p>Distances between the Sun, planets, and the Kuiper belt which is at the edge of our solar system are truly vast. The distance between the Earth and the Sun is 1 AU. That stands for astronomical unit. It is an immense distance and is defined as the distance between us and the Sun. There are around 50 AU to the edge of our solar system from the middle.</p><p>Our solar system is often talked about as flat. There is a relatively simple reason for this.

Earth is one of those rocky planets. The other three are Mercury, Venus, and Mars. These four planets are much smaller than the outer gaseous giants. The rocky planets have some sort of atmosphere.</p><p>Atmospheric conditions are all quite different among the four inner planets though. The Earth is the only planet with oxygen in its atmosphere. There is a tangible surface on all of them too. Surfaces are all different as well.</p><p>The gaseous giants in the outer solar system are different from the inner planets. They are the furthest away from the Sun and have huge orbits. The gas planets are mostly helium and hydrogen. These gases are compressed until they become liquids at their cores. The atmospheres are gaseous, however.</p><p>As far as we know, there are no solid surfaces on the outer planets. Gravity is immense as you get below the outer atmosphere. It is much stronger than here on Earth.</p><p>The magnetic fields on the gaseous planets are much stronger than here on Earth as well. They each have several moons in their immediate orbit. Ring systems are also a common factor among the gas giants.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f9rnt34d86s" class="align-center"><strong>Interstellar Medium</strong></h3><p> </p><p>You might think space was totally empty except for all of those large objects floating around out there. It is not so. There are a multitude of rocks, dust, asteroids, and meteoroids in between everything. Dust forms usually when objects grind together and debris ends up scattered everywhere. Larger objects are created through ancient explosions and collisions that have happened throughout time in our universe.</p><p>Meteoroids and asteroids are rocky objects flying around out there. Anything larger than 100 meters in diameter is an asteroid. Smaller objects are meteoroids. Comets are much larger objects. Their compositions are usually different, as they contain a lot of ice.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f9rnt34d86t" class="align-center"><strong>How Is The Interstellar Medium Important</strong></h3><p> </p><p>By doing detailed studies of the material between the planets, we learn more about how the Solar System formed. This is the material that formed everything else in galaxies. Astronomers assume it is the stuff from early in the universe's history. They are most likely right. Since it is from early on, it gives us clues about the early universe and its conditions. We can usually infer many properties then and know a little more about what happened after everything first formed.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f9rnt34d86u" class="align-center"><strong>The Kuiper Belt</strong></h3><p> </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/59/solar-system-3.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/59/responsive/solar-system-3-xs.jpg 300w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/59/responsive/solar-system-3-sm.jpg 480w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/59/responsive/solar-system-3-md.jpg 768w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/59/responsive/solar-system-3-lg.jpg 1024w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/59/responsive/solar-system-3-xl.jpg 1360w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/59/responsive/solar-system-3-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1600" height="900"><figcaption>https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/kuiper-belt/overview/</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>At the edge of the solar system is a huge asteroid field called the Kuiper belt. We named it from Gerard Kuiper who was a famous astronomer. Located past Neptune, it is at the coldest part of our solar system. It is in the shape of a disc. The belt is filled with matter of all sizes. Sizes of the matter range from dust particles to sub-planets like Pluto. It is likely that the Kuiper belt is the source of most of the comets that we see. They come our way because the comets get thrown out of orbit. While a few comets get vaporized by our Sun, many more make it to travel the solar system.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f9rnt34d86v" class="align-center"><strong>The One Orbital Plane</strong></h3><p> </p><p>Almost every object in our solar system orbits or travels in the same plane. I mentioned this earlier but did not explain why. I am getting to that now. With so many celestial bodies in space, you might be tempted to think their orbits and paths would be all over the place. It would be easy to think this because there is just so much out there!</p><p>That is not the case though. Almost everything is on the same plane. Obviously there must be a common cause to this phenomenon. There sure is.</p><p>There is one object in our solar system that has the influence to accomplish the feat of aligning everything into a single plane. It is our massive Sun. The plane that everything travels about is the same as the Sun’s equator. The overwhelming and crushing gravity of our Sun handles this. There are a few minor exceptions where objects were hit and knocked a bit off path but there are very few of these.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f9rnt34d870" class="align-center"><strong>Formation of the Solar System</strong></h3><p> </p><p>What probably happened, in a simple sense, is that a large disc formed that had a lot of matter in it. This disc was rotating rapidly and eventually matter stuck together. Over time, some matter broke apart and other matter got larger. The larger pieces grew to be planets and moons. The largest piece of matter was our Sun, that was much different then.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f9rnt34d871" class="align-center"><strong>Accretion</strong></h3><p> </p><p>These primitive discs are accretion discs. They grow by having matter collide and stick together. Gravity is the mechanism responsible for everything staying together. Small objects eventually become larger matter. The process just continues over and over.</p><p>Planetary systems and Black holes have this in common. Each can have accretion discs and grow in the same way. Of course different things can happen in Black holes but I will get to that another day.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f9rnt34d872" class="align-center"><strong>Planet Characteristics</strong></h3><p> </p><p>I mentioned earlier that the planets closer to the sun were more rocky and those further away were gas giants. There are reasons for this. The main one is temperature. Temperature affects a lot of things in the solar system. In this case, it determines how matter behaves and what elements can form.</p><p>So what happens on the planets close to the Sun is that it is too hot for matter to stay together. In ways it is the same principle why we use hot water to clean things rather than cold water. The higher the temperature the easier it is for the water to break chemical bonds of dirt and other matter that may be on your hands when you wash them.</p><p>It’s the same principle next to the Sun. Matter exposed to those high temperatures breaks apart much easier. Therefore, only the larger chunks of matter remain. That is why there are only rocky planets close to the Sun and why there are gas giants in the cooler regions of the solar system.</p><p>In the outer solar system, that matter did not break apart because it was much cooler out there. Clouds of dust formed and stayed together. Gases stayed together and compacted, forming dense clouds. The early gas giants formed in this way after accreting enough material to form a core. Then gravity started affecting things like it always does.</p><p>In short, that is why the inner solar system planets are so much different from the outer planets.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f9rnt34d873" class="align-center"><strong>Formation Of The Large Planets</strong></h3><p> </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/59/solar-system-4.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/59/responsive/solar-system-4-xs.jpg 300w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/59/responsive/solar-system-4-sm.jpg 480w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/59/responsive/solar-system-4-md.jpg 768w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/59/responsive/solar-system-4-lg.jpg 1024w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/59/responsive/solar-system-4-xl.jpg 1360w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/59/responsive/solar-system-4-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="676" height="380"><figcaption><cite class="Text-module__typo___2-LMx Text-module__caption-1___EYH0z Images-module__ImageDrawerLink___2mwDa" data-testid="imageDrawerLink">astrobiology.nasa.gov</cite></figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>There are different theories about how Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune formed.</p><p>One of which implies that the original bodies that would become these planets slowly leeched gas from its nebula. Growing like this would be possible because of a strong gravity field.</p><p>The other dominant theory says that these large planets formed directly from the collapsed cloud. Strong gravity caused the cloud of gas to become unstable and break apart.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f9rnt34d874" class="align-center"><strong>How Did The Sun Influence The Gas Giants</strong></h3><p> </p><p>The gas giants are mostly that, just gas. Hydrogen and helium constitute most matter in them. They got all this gas from the nebula in which they were first born. As long as there is gas, then they will continue to grow.</p><p>Our Sun was already forming too. You know every star goes through a series of phases in its development as a star. One of these phases is the [T Tauri] phase. During this time the Sun has incredible stellar winds. Stellar winds are powerful and will blow away the nebula of gases around it.</p><p>So when the nebula disperses, planets that grow by leeching gas will stop their growth at this point. This bring up two important points.</p><ol><li><p>If the Sun grows slowly, it will reach its [T Tauri] phase with high winds much slower. This lets the gas giants get a lot larger.</p></li><li><p>When our Sun grows quickly, it reaches the [T Tauri] phase quickly and disperses the gas. Therefore, planets made of gas will be smaller.</p></li><li> </li></ol><h3 id="mcetoc_1f9rnt34d875" class="align-center"><strong>Why Are There Definitions Of Planets</strong></h3><p> </p><p>They are so different, that’s why. It just makes sense to divide them up like this. I am not sure who first proposed this idea, but it made sense. Almost every property is vastly different. Because of this, we can compare either inner or outer planets to similar groups that orbit around other stars. Usually we can infer they have similar properties in doing this too.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f9rnt34d876" class="align-center"><strong>Movement Of The Planets</strong></h3><p> </p><p>There is also an interesting theory that says our gas giants came from far away and not created where they are now orbiting at. This theory basically says that they formed in the Kuiper Belt and moved towards the Sun slowly. The reasoning is that the gases that are now on the Jovian planets could not have gone through the planet formation stages at high temperatures. So some think they formed way out in the Kuiper Belt.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1f9rnt34d877" class="align-center"><strong>Where The Water Came From</strong></h3><p> </p><p>It has been long understood that the water in our solar system came mostly from comets. There are certainly reasons that make this plausible. One of which is the frequency that comets occur in our solar system. They are constantly floating around out there. There are issues with this.</p><p>One main issue is that it takes a lot of comets to bring that much water. It is true that comets are frequent visitors in our solar system but that is still a lot of water. Once a comet gets close to a planet wouldn’t the friction of the atmosphere burn up most of the water? Even if they made it to the surface, a fiery explosion creates a lot of heat too which would also burn up the water vapor. So there are a few holes and doubts in this theory too, at least to me.</p><p> </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1fg7pfrl19b3" class="align-center"><strong>How Do Telescopes Work</strong></h2><p> </p><p>Telescopes are being used differently as time goes on. We used to only use them to see objects in normal light. Now we can leverage our technology gains to see different wavelengths of light in the universe.</p><p>This has opened up our studies with a lot more data than we previously had. This article talks about the different fields and categories of astronomy and what they mean.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1fg7pfrl19b4" class="align-center"><strong>Essentials of Telescopes</strong></h3><p> </p><p>There are many kinds of telescopes. With many uses as well, there is a diverse market for every kind of telescope you could imagine. Narrowing down what your goal is can save you a lot of money in the end. When looking for a telescope, there are a few terms you should know.</p><ul><li><p>Aperture  - This is the size of the mirror and is the most important factor.</p></li><li><p>Focal Length  - This is the distance from the mirror to the focal point.</p></li><li><p>Magnification  - This depends on the focal length and is a good indicator of the telescope.</p></li><li><p>Focal Ratio  - The focal ratio is the relationship between its focal length and the aperture of the telescope.</p></li></ul><p>To do any meaningful research, you need a telescope, a wavelength filter or spectrometer, and a detector. The telescope needs to be as large as possible. A larger aperture gathers more light.</p><p>Bigger telescopes see fainter objects. Once they gather light, they can focus this light into an image. This is how they generally work, no matter the type of radiation.</p><p>The wavelength filter can be a variety of devices. Filters can be simple or complex. They can show you one color or a rainbow. It depends on what you are after. Different colors give different information.</p><p>After light has been collected, you must use a device to detect the wavelengths you are after. With a detector, you can get long exposures. This is key to observing faint objects far away.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1fg7pfrl19b5" class="align-center"><strong>Optical Telescopes</strong></h3><p> </p><p> </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/telescopes-1.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/responsive/telescopes-1-xs.jpg 300w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/responsive/telescopes-1-sm.jpg 480w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/responsive/telescopes-1-md.jpg 768w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/responsive/telescopes-1-lg.jpg 1024w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/responsive/telescopes-1-xl.jpg 1360w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/responsive/telescopes-1-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="507" height="380"><figcaption><cite class="Text-module__typo___2-LMx Text-module__caption-1___EYH0z Images-module__ImageDrawerLink___2mwDa" data-testid="imageDrawerLink">china.org.cn</cite></figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>Optical telescopes collect visible light. That is why they are optical. Seems simple enough, right? It really is. The more light we then collect, the more we can see.</p><p>When people think of telescopes, these are the type that are thought of when first learning the basics of telescopes. It is how we use telescopes. There are two main kinds of optical telescopes:</p><ul><li><p>Refracting- bends light that is then focused.</p></li><li><p>Reflecting- uses a mirror to reflect light.</p></li></ul><p>Refracting scopes use a lens to gather and concentrate light. They do not do colors as accurately as they should either. A lens will also absorb some frequencies through the atmosphere. This makes a refracting telescope a poor choice for infrared studies.</p><p>Using a lens in your telescope is also more expensive. This is because a lot more quality and effort goes into a lens.</p><p>Reflecting telescopes use mirrors instead of a lens to work with the light that is captured. Since they use a mirror, there are no absorption issues to deal with. You can also use a much larger mirror than a lens.</p><p>So scopes that are large almost always use a mirror. Among reflecting telescopes there are different ones as well:</p><ul><li><p>Newtonian-reflected to an eyepiece at side of instrument</p></li><li><p>Cassegrain-light reflects light at the end of the instrument</p></li></ul><p>The Keck Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope are the two most famous. They based Keck in Hawaii while Hubble is orbiting in space.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1fg7pfrl19b6" class="align-center"><strong>Size Of Telescopes</strong></h3><p> </p><p>The size of telescopes has grown over time. Originally they were pretty small in Galileo’s day. However, thanks to modern science, we are getting larger ones all the time. Indeed, the space telescopes are also getting bigger.</p><p>What is the advantage to a larger telescope you may ask? Well, the larger the telescope the more light it can collect. It is all about the amount of light it can gather. This helps us see far off objects.</p><p>The telescope’s mirror directly affects how much we can see. This helps with another issue, which is the telescope’s resolving power. Its resolution is also very important because it lets us see the details of objects in space.</p><p>For example, it lets us study far off objects and refine our theory of star classification.</p><p>A larger mirror also helps with diffraction. This is the tendency of light to bend. Basically, the larger the mirror the less bending of light, or diffraction, that you will have.</p><p>Presently, telescopes can be huge. The largest ones are 10-11 meters in diameter. Larger ones are being built. I imagine, there will always be a larger one being built.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1fg7pfrl19b7" class="align-center"><strong>Imaging With Telescopes</strong></h3><p> </p><p> </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/telescopes-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/responsive/telescopes-2-xs.jpg 300w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/responsive/telescopes-2-sm.jpg 480w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/responsive/telescopes-2-md.jpg 768w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/responsive/telescopes-2-lg.jpg 1024w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/responsive/telescopes-2-xl.jpg 1360w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/responsive/telescopes-2-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="474" height="474"><figcaption><cite class="Text-module__typo___2-LMx Text-module__caption-1___EYH0z Images-module__ImageDrawerLink___2mwDa" data-testid="imageDrawerLink">fixthephoto.com</cite></figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>Imaging and the field of astrophotography are very popular these days because looking through a telescope is looking back in time. When individuals first want to know how telescopes are used, imaging the night sky is one of the first choices.</p><p>More and more people all the time are doing this because of how useful and fun it is. The pictures created are just breathtaking. Computers and associated software are being used to make this process even easier and more reliable.</p><p>Done correctly, they can even reduce background noise in pictures. The background noise also has its own characteristics. It can then be analyzed and useful information will be the result.</p><p>So what exactly is imaging then you may ask? It is the process of taking very long-exposure photographs of cosmic objects. While your camera is doing this it goes onto its film.</p><p>There is a slight problem with this though. Can you guess? Yep, the Earth and everything moves. For astrophotographers, to take those stunning pictures the telescope has to move.</p><p>If you are interested in astrophotography, then you will buy a telescope that has a guidance system included in it that will track planets and stars.</p><p>This means there is a small computer that will adjust position in far greater detail than we could ever do by hand. The purpose is to keep our object that is being photographed squared.</p><p>Most often this was done by hand, and it could be quite difficult. It was easy to make errors doing it this way.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1fg7pfrl19b8" class="align-center"><strong>CCD Chips</strong></h3><p> </p><p>Fairly recently technology has advanced and new CCD chips have come on to the market. CCD stands for charged coupled devices. These chips take digital images of objects. On the CCD, a pixel stores the photonic information that it gathers.</p><p>Just like the previous method it takes time to gather enough light and information on to these chips but the results can be wonderful. These CCD’s record starlight and allow much greater visibility into the heavens.</p><p>This process allows us to detect and analyze the faintest objects. Without doing this, we would not know they were there.</p><p>These chips also can auto guide, making the following of an object a much simpler process if you have the cash to pay for the hardware.</p><p>These chips are much more efficient than previous methods. Think cell phone camera versus Polaroid.</p><p>This leads to the next subject, which can be very useful. It is the study of brightness of any object. We call this photometry. Astronomers combine photometry with the use of filters to analyze certain wavelengths.</p><p>As each range of wavelength can have unique characteristics, this is precious. To measure the light, a telescope takes it in and then we use an instrument called a photometer. It measures the amount of light received.</p><p><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-spectroscopy.html">Spectroscopy</a>, which is the study of the spectrum of light, goes right along with this. Without even looking at the source image, we can infer much from this and is one of the most important topics when dealing with the basics of telescopes.</p><p>It is hard to get splendid pictures while on Earth. It is not really our fault though. The atmosphere affects our view so much. Not a lot we can do from here. Therefore, we launched telescopes into space.</p><p>Turbulence in the air is constantly messing with our telescopes and imaging. An interesting fact is that turbulence has less effect on longer wavelengths.</p><p>I do not know why this is but guessing it is because smaller wavelengths are much more sensitive. Because of turbulence, we usually place telescopes at high altitudes.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1fg7pfrl19b9" class="align-center"><strong>Telescope Resolution</strong></h3><p> </p><p>Resolution is the detail in an image. We want as much as possible. With higher resolution, the smallest features become apparent. This is vital in the study of astronomy. Aperture size is the key ingredient of resolution.</p><p>The larger the aperture, the sharper the image becomes.</p><figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E4un8WFLD3A" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure><p>Our atmosphere contains many gas pockets. These pockets catch and distort the starlight. They distort it by making it reach Earth in weird ways. This is the big problem with optical telescopes.</p><p>The distortion of our atmosphere disrupts viewing a lot. Therefore, astronomers go to the highest and driest places available for viewing.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1fg7pfrl19ba" class="align-center"><strong>Radio Astronomy</strong></h3><p> </p><p> </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/telescopes-3.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/responsive/telescopes-3-xs.jpg 300w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/responsive/telescopes-3-sm.jpg 480w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/responsive/telescopes-3-md.jpg 768w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/responsive/telescopes-3-lg.jpg 1024w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/responsive/telescopes-3-xl.jpg 1360w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/responsive/telescopes-3-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="577" height="380"><figcaption><cite class="Text-module__typo___2-LMx Text-module__caption-1___EYH0z Images-module__ImageDrawerLink___2mwDa" data-testid="imageDrawerLink">public.nrao.edu</cite></figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>Radio astronomy, as we know it, was first started in the 1930s. We credit it to<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Guthe_Jansky"> Karl Jansky</a>. He was working on radio communications when he discovered radio waves from an unknown source away from Earth.</p><p>Since an abundance of radio waves reach us on the ground, radio astronomy is a growing field. Also, since radio waves are a lot longer than, say gamma waves, the atmosphere does little to them.</p><p>In fact, radio waves are the longest form of radiation. Radio astronomy has only begun in the last few decades so we have a lot to learn about these techniques.</p><p>We can use radio waves to map out areas in space with much greater detail than using optical <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/getting-started-with-astronomy-2.html">astronomy</a>. It’s like this because the atmosphere doesn’t affect a radio telescope. This is very useful because we can not actually see these areas with our eyes.</p><p>Radio telescopes have an enormous dish which is their collecting area for the radio waves it captures. It is so large because radio waves are quite rare compared to other kinds of radiation that hits the Earth.</p><p>Therefore, we need to maximize our chance at capturing these them. They also operate differently than optical telescopes in that they only see a few wavelengths at a time of radiation.</p><p>A tremendous advantage with radio astronomy is that poor conditions mean nothing. For example, if you want to go see a meteor shower and it is cloudy, then you are out of luck. It is the same situation with any optical telescope on Earth.</p><p>If there is too much moisture or cloud cover, then we just have to wait until conditions get better. Radio telescopes do not have this problem as radio waves are not affected.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1fg7pfrl19bb" class="align-center"><strong>Interferometry</strong></h3><p> </p><p>One of the main issues with radio astronomy is the poor resolution. Those telescopes are not near as good as optical telescopes in showing details of an object. This is where interferometry comes in to play. Interferometry is when two telescopes are used together to view an object.</p><p>They are linked together to form an array of telescopes. This makes it possible for them to be very geographically separated.</p><p>As each radio telescope takes in data, we then combined the data again using special software that makes a superior image than either took to begin with.</p><p>When used together like this an interferometer can make brilliant images which get very close to optical images. An important fact to know is that great distances separate the two radio telescopes that work together.</p><p>By this I mean they can be on different continents or even further than that sometimes.</p><p>A very interesting thing happened as technology and computers got better in recent years. Instead of just detecting radio waves, we can now also detect smaller wavelengths. This opens up our universe even more.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1fg7pfrl19bc" class="align-center"><strong>Infrared Astronomy</strong></h3><p> </p><p> </p><p>Infrared telescopes are used to study longer wavelength radiation, and it is a good example of how telescopes are used to study light that we can not see. This is a very popular field.</p><p>Longer wavelengths are easier to detect than much shorter wavelengths like gamma rays. A good example of this type of astronomy is the Spitzer Space Telescope. It has given us some truly great images.</p><p>This is an important field because it lets us see the universe without the issues of light pollution. Interstellar dust is everywhere out there.</p><p>There is so much of it, it makes some gigantic clouds. All of this dust makes seeing difficult. The dust can completely block out a lot of faint objects.</p><p>Therefore, studies of the infrared spectrum are valuable. They let us see without our eyes. In the electromagnetic spectrum, infrared lies between visible light and microwave radiation. Its wavelengths are a little shorter than microwaves.</p><p>Any object that produces heat gives infrared radiation off. It can be a lot of heat like the sun or just a small amount like the snow. Both still puts off some heat and therefore radiate infrared radiation.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1fg7pfrl19bd" class="align-center"><strong>Ultraviolet Astronomy</strong></h3><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the shorter wavelengths, we have ultraviolet astronomy. This is short wavelength astronomy. In this niche area of astronomy, it is ultraviolet radiation that is studied. The wavelengths of this radiation are around 90 to 350 nanometers.</p><p>As with all the other areas of astronomy, you can tell a lot about the object when studying its radiation. Examples of what we can infer are densities, composition, and temperatures.</p><p>We divided the ultraviolet spectrum up into the near, far, and extreme ultraviolet regions.</p><p>One of the cool things about ultraviolet radiation is that the objects with the highest temperatures in the universe give off a lot of ultraviolet radiation. This makes it an excellent source to study.</p><p>To study this type of radiation, we usually have to analyze data taken by space telescopes. I should point out that we use space telescopes to gather ultraviolet radiation because the Earth’s atmosphere blocks most of the ultraviolet waves.</p><p>Basically, to get to them we must be in space.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1fg7pfrl19be" class="align-center"><strong>High Energy Astronomy</strong></h3><p> </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/telescopes-4.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/responsive/telescopes-4-xs.jpg 300w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/responsive/telescopes-4-sm.jpg 480w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/responsive/telescopes-4-md.jpg 768w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/responsive/telescopes-4-lg.jpg 1024w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/responsive/telescopes-4-xl.jpg 1360w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/61/responsive/telescopes-4-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="472" height="380"><figcaption><cite class="Text-module__typo___2-LMx Text-module__caption-1___EYH0z Images-module__ImageDrawerLink___2mwDa" data-testid="imageDrawerLink">fr.m.wikipedia.org</cite></figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>This is the part of the spectrum that is least known to us. High energy astronomy deals with gamma rays and x-rays. They are hard to detect and to capture. Gamma rays, in particular, have the most energy of any other type of radiation.</p><p>One of the really cool things about them is that they penetrate everything. This makes gamma rays hard to deal with.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1fg7pfrl19bf" class="align-center"><strong>X-Rays</strong></h3><p> </p><p>An interesting fact is that the gamma rays and x-rays cover a large part of the electromagnetic spectrum. In contrast, visible light only covers a small fraction of the spectrum.</p><p> </p><p>Just about every day we are discovering more sources for x-rays and gamma rays. The list is skyrocketing. However, there are many more sources for x-rays than gamma rays. In our galaxy, the Sun is the closest emitting source.</p><p>Throughout the galaxy there are sources that send forth much more radiation than our Sun. We call these the x-ray binaries which are systems of stars in which one is probably a neutron star.</p><p>These objects produce fantastic amounts of high energy radiation. Another super source of x-rays is supernovae which can send the detectors through the roof.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1fg7pfrl19bg" class="align-center"><strong>Gamma Rays</strong></h3><p> </p><p>Right now there are only about 3000 known sources for gamma rays. That number should explain how rare they really are. As a result, it is more difficult to do a study using spectroscopy because other wavelengths are much more common.</p><p>We can sometimes wait a long time before we can detect one. Even more rarely we can observe gamma rays in lightning bolts or certain kinds of nuclear explosions. The typical gamma ray is highly energetic. This means that it contains an abundance of energy.</p><p>Its energy is so great that we use it in the medical industry to kill certain cancers. I can’t think of a better way to harness nature for a good cause!</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1fg7pfrl19bh" class="align-center"><strong>The Astronomer’s Life</strong></h3><p> </p><p>Astronomers rarely peer into an eyepiece like they used to. There are a couple reasons for this. One reason is that technology has advanced, and it allows us to do so much more with the data gathered by a telescope.</p><p>The other reason is that the atmosphere is degrading which makes seeing objects a lot harder. This is mostly due to all the satellites launched in the last few years. A lot less star light gets to us now.</p><p>The light that we can see is often distorted because of our atmosphere.</p><p>Most Astronomers spend their time in front of a computer. They are using software to analyze data. They want to use the good telescopes but these have limited time. So they might get a few days a year and spend the rest of the time analyzing their data.</p><p> </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1fg7pfrl19bi" class="align-center"><strong>Why Does The Earth Support Life</strong></h2><p> </p><p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">The Earth is an averaged sized planet in our <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/introduction-to-the-solar-system.html"><em>Solar System</em></a>.

Since it is denser oxygen, it is very effective at stopping radiation from outer space, harming us here on Earth. </p><p>The atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. There are a few other trace amounts of gases. These gases form a fine balance for our living conditions. If there were less or more of them, life would not be possible in the way we know it currently.</p><p>We do not know how our atmosphere originally formed. There are guesses involving impacts from outer space, volcanic activity, and formation along with the surface. There is evidence of them all, so deciding on one is not feasible right now. So, most think it is a combination of these events.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1fc1otahug0" class="align-center"><strong> Earth’s Weather</strong></h3><p> </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/63/why-does-the-earth-support-life-5.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/63/responsive/why-does-the-earth-support-life-5-xs.jpg 300w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/63/responsive/why-does-the-earth-support-life-5-sm.jpg 480w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/63/responsive/why-does-the-earth-support-life-5-md.jpg 768w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/63/responsive/why-does-the-earth-support-life-5-lg.jpg 1024w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/63/responsive/why-does-the-earth-support-life-5-xl.jpg 1360w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/63/responsive/why-does-the-earth-support-life-5-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="393" height="380"><figcaption>credit: <cite class="Text-module__typo___2-LMx Text-module__caption-1___EYH0z Images-module__ImageDrawerLink___2mwDa" data-testid="imageDrawerLink">universetoday.com</cite></figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>Every celestial object with an atmosphere has weather. Weather is the circulation of our atmosphere and its effects on the surface. The Sun plays a significant role in our weather patterns. Its radiation heats the surface, which gives the atmosphere energy.</p><p>Rotation of the Earth plays a role as well. As our planet spins, different areas get direct sunlight. This will create weather patterns unique to those particular areas. Weather has the same effects year after year in regions. This gives rise to a climate that does not change much when looked at for long periods of time.</p><p>Climates change, though. Change often takes thousands of years for permanent effects to take place. However, change has happened continually on Earth for its multi billion year history.</p><p>Therefore, we should not be surprised that climates change and different regions shift its weather patterns. For example, oceans became deserts and vice versa. This has happened many times in our history and will happen many times more. </p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1fc1otahug1" class="align-center"><strong>Life On Earth</strong></h3><p> </p><figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9RTkZaX1cH0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure><p> </p><p>Since the Earth is the only place we have identified life, scientists have been trying to figure out why this is. Life has been here since our planet’s very beginning stages. We do not know how long life has been here, but it’s estimated to be around 4 billion years. </p><p>Why did life form here but in no other place in our Solar System? There is not an answer for that yet. Many planets have similar formations. We can assume close to the same conditions in countless other planets in other Solar Systems too. </p><p>Our atmosphere and surface were much different 3-4 billion years ago. There was very little to no oxygen early in our history. Despite this, life has consistently grown and and become more sophisticated.  </p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1fg7pfrl19bj" class="align-center"><strong>Why Is The Sky Blue</strong></h3><p> </p><p>The sky is blue because of the scattering throughout our atmosphere. Specifically, light is scattered through air and dust molecules. Scattering is where radiation is absorbed and redirected. When radiation is redirected, blue light is scattered easier.</p><p>Blue light is scattered easier because its wavelength is on the smaller side. Since it is smaller, it gets distributed through the air more. This makes our sky blue. </p><p>This effect is also why the Sun appears yellow or orange, depending on time of day. In the early morning or late evening the Sun will appear orange. This is because radiation of the Sun has a lot more atmosphere to travel through to reach our eyes than midday. </p><p>Since there is more atmosphere to travel through, the blue wavelengths are almost totally gone or scattered through the atmosphere by the time that radiation reaches our eyes. Being gone, all that is left are the other wavelengths. This makes the Sun appear orange to us.</p><p> </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1fg7pfrl19bk" class="align-center"><strong>Why Is There Debris In The Galaxy</strong></h2><p> </p><p>When people think of our solar system, they often just think of the planets and larger objects.

They are smaller than planets. Astronomers sometimes call them planetoids. Their orbits are pretty crazy and eccentric.</p><p>Most are pretty small. In fact, most moons that we know of are much larger than asteroids. We refer to asteroids as debris for this reason. Since they are so small on average, their combined mass is not much.</p><p><a href="https://space.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_asteroids" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asteroids</a> are usually discovered by Astronomers searching for larger objects. They are usually searching for planets and things like that. When scanning the sky or watching for transits, asteroids will show up in the most unexpected of places.</p><p>Astronomers reportedly first discovered an asteroid a little over 200 years ago. Of course, I am sure we saw them, but observers did not know what they were. I am sure they were mistaken for other things in the sky.</p><p>Most asteroids that were discovered are in the famous asteroid belt. Almost all the known asteroids are in this region. It is a belt that orbits the Sun and there are many thousands of asteroids there.</p><p>Why are there so many in one region? Most astronomers think they are remnants of an explosion that never formed into a planet. This is because there is far too little mass for them to be a broken up planet. They then escape into the solar system. This happens when they collide with each other and they are responsible for most of the cratering seen around the solar system.</p><p>Asteroids are a major source of debris in the galaxy. While not very large, there are a multitude of them. They are also easy to find when you want to look for them.</p><p>They are usually denser than comets because of their composition.

However, they differ greatly from asteroids. Telescopes from far away can pick them up. Comets are almost always brighter than asteroids. This is because they reflect sunlight. Sunlight is reflected because comets are mostly ice chunks and this makes them highly reflective. This also makes them less dense than asteroids because they contain a lot of water ice.</p><p><a href="https://nineplanets.org/comets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comets</a> have highly eccentric orbits. Most of us will only see a particular comet once because of their very long travel period. Orbits can be a hundred years to millions of years.</p><p>They have a nucleus, coma, hydrogen envelope, and tail. These attributes can all vary in size. Their characteristics all change, depending on how close to the Sun they are. The nucleus makes up most of their mass. When they get close to the Sun, the envelope and tail form.</p><p>Most comets come from the Kuiper Belt and the Oort cloud. These are regions left over from the formation of the galaxy and contain millions, if not billions, of comets.

They often appear in our night sky as streaks of light. Friction and the Earth’s atmosphere cause these streaks of light. Friction heats the meteor, and this process emits light.</p><p>The smaller <a href="https://www.space.com/topics/meteors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">meteors</a> are probably pieces of comets that broke apart. As comets get near the Sun, parts break away and these become meteors. Their density is very similar to a comet.</p><p>However, the larger meteors that make it to the ground are more similar to asteroids. Their density is much greater. So that tells us something else happened. It could be a stray object from the asteroid belt or a fragment from some collision. It is hard to say for sure.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1fg7dnsc628o" class="align-center"><strong>Origins Of Debris</strong></h3><p> </p><p>I mentioned the Kuiper Belt and Asteroid Belt earlier. These regions are where most of our galaxy debris come from. Their objects constantly collide with each other and then shoot off in different directions. This is how everything gets scattered around.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1fg7dnsc628p" class="align-center"><strong>The Asteroid Belt</strong></h3><p> </p><p>The Asteroid Belt is the boundary between the inner and outer planets in our galaxy. The asteroids contained within are classified into wet and dry objects. We do not know how this asteroid belt formed exactly. There are a few different theories, of course.</p><p>One of the leading theories is that the asteroid belt was leftover from the formation of the Sun. This is certainly plausible. Astronomers think some of our large planets came from this left over material too.</p><p>Another theory is that this region just filled up with these planetesimals. This is because it was a region devoid of material and rocky objects slowly got trapped by the Sun as they wandered by.</p><p>Both theories are equally plausible. It will take more time and data before a leading theory can emerge.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1fg7dnsc628q" class="align-center"><strong>The Kuiper Belt</strong></h3><p> </p><p>The other primary source of debris in the galaxy is the Kuiper belt. This is an extensive region of rocks, asteroids, and comets. It starts around 30 AU from the Sun and it is around 50 AU thick. This means it encircles our solar system, and it is quite large. Like the Asteroid Belt, when collisions occur, objects get sent directly into the solar system.</p><p>Also similar to the Asteroid belt, the Kuiper Belt is leftover remnants of the formation of the Solar System. Astronomers think it could have come together to form a planet if Neptune had not interfered with its gravity. Its gravity disrupted the Kuiper Belt so often, so the pieces could never come together.</p><p>Astronomers think the Kuiper Belt used to be much larger. Our large gas giants have captured much of the material there. Constant collisions have ejected objects toward the Solar System and the surrounding Oort Cloud. The ejected objects are both asteroids and comets, depending on their makeup.</p><p>Many of the objects in the Kuiper Belt are large and have their own moons. We do not know exact numbers, but there are probably thousands of such objects.</p><p> </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on September 22, 2021</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy/">Astronomy</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fan-introduction-to-astronomy.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fan-introduction-to-astronomy.html&amp;via=Science%20By%20Jason&amp;text=An%20Introduction%20To%20Astronomy" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/a-first-look-at-algebra-and-number-sets.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> A First Look At Algebra and Number Sets</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/the-evolution-of-stars.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> The Evolution Of Stars </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2017-05-13T14:37" class="feed__date">May 13, 2017</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-the-solar-system.html" class="invert">Astronomy For Beginners: The Solar System</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2017-03-01T22:40" class="feed__date">March 1, 2017</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-how-telescopes-are-used.html" class="invert">Astronomy For Beginners: How Telescopes Are Used</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2017-01-24T20:25" class="feed__date">January 24, 2017</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-spectroscopy.html" class="invert">How Spectroscopy Is Used In Astronomy</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><link href="//cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/classic-10_7.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><style type="text/css">#mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }
