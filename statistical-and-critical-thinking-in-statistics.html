Surveys guide political candidates, shape business practices, influence social media, and affect many aspects of our lives. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A voluntary response sample is a sample in which respondents themselves decide whether to participate. Those with a strong interest in the topic are more likely to participate. Sample data must be collected in an appropriate way, such as through a process of random selection. If sample data are not collected in an appropriate way, the data may be so completely useless that no amount of statistical torturing can salvage them.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When using methods of statistics with sample data to form conclusions about a population, it is absolutely essential to collect sample data in a way that is appropriate. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data are collections of observations, such as measurements, genders, or survey responses. A single data value is called a datum. The term data is plural.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statistics is the science of planning studies and experiments, obtaining data, and organizing, summarizing, presenting, analyzing, and interpreting those data and then drawing conclusions based on them. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A population is the complete collection of all measurements or data that are being considered. Typically, a population is the complete collection of data that we would like to make inferences about. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A census is the collection of data from every member of the population.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sample is a subcollection of members selected from a population.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because populations are often very large, a common objective of the use of statistics is to obtain data from a sample and then use those data to form a conclusion about the population.</span></p><p><br><br></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A voluntary response sample is one in which the respondents themselves decide whether to be included.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The word statistics is derived from the Latin word status, meaning state. Early uses of statistics involved compilations of data and graphs describing various aspects of a state or country. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following types of polls are common examples of voluntary response samples. By their very nature, all are seriously flawed because we should not make conclusions about a population on the basis of samples with a strong possibility of bias.</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet polls: people online can decide whether to respond.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mail-in polls: in which people can decide whether to reply.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telephone polls:in which newspaper, radio, or television announcements ask that you call a special number to respond.</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><strong>Analyze</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After completing our preparation by considering the context, source, and sampling method, we begin to analyze the data.</span></p><p><strong>Graph and Explore</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An analysis should begin with appropriate graphs and explorations of data.</span></p><p><strong>Apply Statistical Methods</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good statistical analysis does not require strong computational skills. A good statistical analysis does require using common sense and paying careful attention to sound statistical methods.</span></p><p><strong>Conclude</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final step in our statistical process involves conclusions, and we should develop an ability to distinguish between statistical significance and practical significance. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statistical significance is achieved in a study when we get a result that is very unlikely to occur by chance. A common criterion is that we have statistical significance if the likelihood of an event occurring by chance is 5 percent or less. Getting 98 girls in 100 random births is statistically significant because such an extreme outcome is not likely to result from random chance. Getting 52 girls in 100 births is not statistically significant because that event could easily occur with random chance.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Practical significance is when it is possible that some treatment or finding is effective, but common sense might suggest that the treatment or finding does not make enough of a difference to justify its use or to be practical.</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Misleading Conclusions</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When forming a conclusion based on a statistical analysis, we should make statements that are clear even to those who have no understanding of statistics and its terminology. We should carefully avoid making statements not justified by statistical analysis. </span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Sample Data Reported</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When collecting data from people, it is better to take measurements yourself instead of asking subjects to report results. Ask people what they weigh and you are likely to get their desired weights, not their actual weight. </span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Loaded Questions</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If survey questions are not worded carefully, the results of a study can be misleading. Survey questions can be loaded or intentionally worded to elicit a desired response. </span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order of Questions</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes survey questions are unintentionally loaded by such factors as the order of the items being considered. </span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Nonresponse</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A nonresponse occurs when someone either refuses to respond to a survey question or is unavailable. When people are asked survey questions, some firmly refuse to answer. </span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Percentages</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To find a percentage of an amount, replace the % symbol with division by 100, and then interpret “of” to be multiplication. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">6% of 1200 responses = \(\frac{6}{100} * 1200 = 72 \)</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Decimal to Percentage</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To convert from a decimal to a percentage, multiply by 100%.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[ 0.25 \rightarrow 0.25 * 100% = 25% \]</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Fraction to Percentage</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To convert from a fraction to a percentage, divide the denominator into the numerator to get an equivalent decimal number. Then multiply by 100 percent.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[ \frac{}3}{4} = 0.75 \rightarrow 0.75 * 100% = 75% \]</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Percentage to Decimal</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To convert from a percentage to a decimal number, replace the % symbol with division by 100. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[ 85% = \frac{85}{100} = 0.85 \]</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A parameter is a numerical measurement describing some characteristic of a population.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A statistic is a numerical measurement describing some characteristic of a sample.</span></p><p><br><br></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we have more than one statistic, we have statistics. Another meaning of statistics is the science of planning studies and experiments; obtaining data, organizing, summarizing, presenting, analyzing, and interpreting those data.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some data are numbers representing counts or measurements, whereas others are attributes that are not counts or measurements. Quantitative data consist of numbers representing counts or measurements. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Categorical data consist of names or labels. Categorical data are sometimes coded with numbers, with those numbers replacing names. Although such numbers might appear to be quantitative, they are actually categorical data. </span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Include Units of Measurement</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With quantitative data, it is important to use the appropriate units of measurement, such as dollars, hours, feet, or meters. We should carefully observe information given about the units of measurement, such as all amounts are in thousands of dollars or all units are in kilograms. </span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Discrete or Continuous</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quantitative data can be further described by distinguishing between discrete and continuous types. Discrete data result when the data values are quantitative and the number of values is finite. Continuous or numerical data result from infinitely many possible quantitative values, where the collection of values is not countable. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of countable data plays a key role in the preceding definitions, but it is not a particularly easy concept to understand. Continuous data can be measured, but not counted. If you select a particular value from continuous data, there is no next data value.  </span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Levels of Measurement</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another common way of classifying data is to use four levels of measurement; nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. When we are applying statistics to real problems, the level of measurement of the data helps us to decide which procedure to use. Don’t do computations and don’t use statistical methods that are not appropriate for the data. </span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Ratio</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a natural zero starting point and ratios make sense. These are heights, lengths, distances, and volumes.</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Interval</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Differences are meaningful, but there is no natural zero starting point and ratios are meaningless. Body temperatures in degrees is an example.</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Ordinal</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data can be arranged in order, but differences either can’t be found or are meaningless. Examples are ranks of colleges.</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Nominal</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Categories only. Data cannot be arranged in order. An example is eye colors.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nominal level of measurement is characterized by data that consist of names, labels, or categories only. The data cannot be arranged in some order. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because nominal data lack any ordering or numerical significance, they should not be used for calculations. Numbers such as 1,2,3, or 4 are sometimes assigned to the different categories, but these numbers have no real computational significance and any average calculated from them is meaningless and possibly misleading.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data are at the ordinal level of measurement if they can be arranged in some order, but differences between data values cannot be determined or are meaningless.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ordinal data provide information about relative comparisons, but not the magnitudes of the differences. Usually, ordinal data should not be used for calculations such as an average, but this guideline is sometimes ignored.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data are at the interval level of measurement if they can be arranged in order, and differences between data values  can be found and are meaningful. Data at this level do not have a natural zero starting point at which none of the quantity is present. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data are at the ratio level of measurement if they can be arranged in order, differences can be found and are meaningful, and there is a natural zero starting point. For data at this level, differences and ratios are both meaningful.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The distinction between the interval and ratio levels of measurement can be a bit tricky. For the ratio test, focus on the term ratio and know that the term twice describes the ratio of one value to be double the other value. To distinguish between the interval and ratio levels of measurement, use a ratio test by asking this question: Does use of the term twice make sense? Twice makes sense for data at this level of measurement, but it does not make sense for data at the interval level of measurement.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the true zero test, and for ratios to make sense, there must be a value of true zero, where the value of zero indicates that none of the quantity is present, and zero is not simply an arbitrary value on a scale. The temperature of 0 F is arbitrary and does not indicate that there is no heat, so temperatures on the Fahrenheit scale are at the interval level of measurement not the ratio level.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data refers to data sets so large and so complex that their analysis is beyond the capabilities of traditional software tools. Analysis of big data may require software simultaneously running in parallel on many different computers.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data science involves applications of statistics, computer science, and software engineering, along with some other relevant fields such as sociology or finance.</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Example of Data Set Magnitudes</strong></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terabytes </span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petabytes</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exabytes</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zettabytes</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yottabytes</span></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Statistics in Data Science</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The modern data scientist has a solid background in statistics and computer systems as well as expertise in fields that extend beyond statistics. The modern data scientist might be skilled with Hadoop software, which uses parallel processing on many computers for the analysis of big data. The modern data scientist might also have a strong background in some other field such as psychology, biology, medicine, chemistry, or economics.</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Missing Data</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When collecting sample data, it is quite common to find that some values are missing. Ignoring missing data can sometimes create misleading results. If you make the mistake of skipping over a few different samples when you are manually typing them into a statistics software program, the missing values are not likely to have a serious effect on the results. However, if a survey includes many missing salary entries because those with very low incomes are reluctant to reveal their salaries, those missing values will have the serious effect of making salaries appear higher than they really are.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A data value is missing completely at random if the likelihood of its being missing is independent of its value or any of the other values in the data set. That is, any data value is just as likely to be missing as any other data value. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A data value is missing not at random if the missing value is related to the reason that it is missing.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missing data at random can happen and an example is when using a keyboard to manually enter ages of survey respondents and makes the mistake of failing to enter the age of 37 years. The data value is missing completely at random.</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Biased Results</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the two definitions and examples from the previous page, it makes sense to conclude that if we ignore data missing completely at random, the remaining values are not likely to be biased and good results should be obtained. However, if we ignore data that are missing, not at random, it is very possible that the remaining values are biased and results will be misleading.</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Correcting for Missing Data</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are different methods for dealing with missing data. One very common method for dealing with missing data is to delete all subjects having any missing values. If the data are missing completely at random, the remaining values are not likely to be biased and good results can be obtained, but with a smaller sample size. If the data are missing not at random, deleting subjects having any missing values can easily result in a bias among the remaining values, so results can be misleading. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can also input missing data values when we substitute values for them. There are different methods of determining the replacement values, such as using the mean of the other values, or using a randomly selected value from other similar cases, or using a method based on regression analysis. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When analyzing sample data with missing values, try to determine why they are missing, then decide whether it makes sense to treat the remaining values as being representative of the population. If it appears that there are missing values that are missing not at random, know that the remaining data may well be biased and any conclusions based on those remaining values may well be misleading.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an experiment, we apply some treatment and then proceed to observe its effects on the individuals. The individuals in experiments are called experimental units and they are often called subjects when they are people. In an observational study, we observe and measure specific characteristics, but we don’t attempt to modify the individuals being studied. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experiments are often better than observational studies because well planned experiments typically reduce the chance of having the results affected by some variable that is not part of the study. A lurking variable is one that affects the variables included in the study, but it is not included in the study.</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Design of Experiments</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good design of experiments includes replication, blinding, and randomization.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replication is the repetition of an experiment on more than one individual. Good use of replication requires sample sizes that are large enough so that we can see effects of treatments. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blinding is used when the subject doesn’t know whether he or she is receiving a treatment or a placebo. Blinding is a way to get around the placebo effect, which occurs when an untreated subject reports an improvement in symptoms. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Randomization is used when individuals are assigned to different groups through a process of random selection. The logic behind randomization is to use chance as a way to create two groups that are similar. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A simple random sample of n subjects is selected in such a way that every possible sample of the same size n has the same chance of being chosen.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike careless or haphazard sampling, random sampling usually requires very careful planning and execution. </span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Simple Random Sample</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sample of n subjects is selected so that every sample of the same size n has the same chance of being selected</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Systematic Sample</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Select every kth subject</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Convenience Sample</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use data that are very easy to get</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Stratified Sample</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subdivide populations into strata or groups with the same characteristics, then randomly sample within those strata.</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Cluster Sample</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partition the population in clusters or groups, then randoml;y select all members of the selected clusters.</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Multistage Sampling</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional pollsters and government researchers often collect data by using some combination of the preceding sampling methods. In a multistage sample design, pollsters select a sample in different stages, and each stage might use different methods of sampling.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a cross sectional study, data are observed, measured, and collected at one point in time, not over a period of time.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a retrospective study, data are collected from a past timer period by going back in time.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a prospective study, data are collected in the future from groups that share common factors.</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Experiments</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an experiment, confounding occurs when we can see some effect, but we can’t identify the specific factor that caused it.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A randomized block design uses the same basic idea as stratified sampling, but randomized block designs are used when designing experiments, whereas stratified sampling is used for surveys.</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Matched Pairs Design</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compare two treatment groups by using subjects matched in pairs that are somehow related ort have similar characteristics. </span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Rigorously Controlled Design</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carefully assign subjects to different treatment groups, so that those given each treatment are similar in the ways that are important to the experiment.

The logic behind randomization is to use chance as a way to creator two groups that are similar. Although it might seem that we should not leave anything to chance in experiments, randomization has been found to be an extremely effective method for assigning subjects to groups.</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Randomization</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study is conducted to measure children’s growth rates without any treatment applied to the children.
