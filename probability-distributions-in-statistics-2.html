An<br>example is the distance traveled by a car using one gallon of gas. Occasionally,<br>when a discrete variable takes lots of values, it is treated as a continuous<br>variable. <br><br>The probability distribution of a continuous random variable or the continuous<br>probability distribution is a graph or a formula giving all possible values<br>taken by a random variable and the corresponding probabilities. It is also known<br>as the density function, or probability density function. <br><br>Let X be a continuous random variable taking values in the range(a,n). Then, the<br>area under the density curve is equal to the probability. The total probability<br>under the curve =1. The probability that X takes a specific value is equal 0. <br><br>The reason is that the probability of getting any X exactly is 0. For example,<br>the chance of it raining exactly 3.00233221 inches is 0, but the chance of it<br>raining between 3.00 and 3.01 inches is small but measurable. <br><br>This may seem hard to understand but remember that there are an infinite number<br>of points on your probability density function and all of their probabilities<br>add up to 1. Pretend you only have 10 events whose probabilities add up to 1. If<br>they all had equal probability, then each would have a 0.1 probability. Now<br>imagine there are 100 events, you would have a 0.01 probability for each one.<br>Now infinitely many events and the probability goes to 0.<br><br>The cumulative distribution function of a random variable X is \(P(X) \leq<br>x_{0}\) for any \(a &lt; x_{0} &lt; b\). It is equal to 0 for any \(x_0 &lt; a\), and it<br>is equal to 1 for any \(x_0 &gt; b\).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Normal Distribution</strong></span><br>The discovery of the normal distribution is credited with Carl Gauss. It is also<br>known as the bell curve or Gaussian distribution. This is the most commonly used<br>distribution in statistics because it closely approximates the distribution of<br>many different measurements.<br><br>If a random variable x follows a normal distribution with mean \(\mu\) and<br>standard deviation \(\sigma\), then it is denoted \(X=N(\mu \sigma)\). <br><br>The standard normal is the normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard<br>deviation of 1. Any normal random variable can be transformed into the standard<br>normal using the relation \(Z=\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\). The value of variable Z<br>for any specific value of X is known as the z-score. For example, suppose<br>\(X=N(10,2)\). The z-score for X=12.5 is then \(Z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} =<br>\frac{12.5-10}{2}=1.25\).<br><br>This process is called z-scoring. It does not change the distribution at all. It<br>simply changes the units on the x-axis, shifting it over by \(-\mu\) and<br>relabeling the axis in units of standard deviation so that 1 unit =1 standard<br>deviation. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Properties of the Normal Distribution</strong></span><br>It is continuous. It is symmetric around its mean. It is bell-shaped.<br>Mean=median=mode. The curve approaches the horizontal axis on both sides of the<br>mean without ever touching or crossing it. Nearly all of the distributions lie<br>within three standard deviations of the mean. It has two inflection points: one<br>at \(\mu-\sigma\) and one at \(\mu+\sigma\). <br><br>The normal distribution is fully determined by two parameters, mean and<br>variance(standard deviation). The location of the distribution on the number<br>line depends on the mean of the distribution. The shape of the distribution<br>depends on the standard deviation. A normal distribution with a larger standard<br>deviation is more spread out, while one with a smaller standard deviation is<br>more tightly bunched. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Using the Normal Distribution Table</strong></span><br>If the random variable X follows a normal distribution with mean \(\mu\) and<br>standard deviation \(\sigma\), then the random variable<br>\(Z=\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\) follows a standard normal distribution, a normal<br>distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. <br><br>To find the area under the standard normal distribution, a normal distribution<br>with mean 0 and standard deviation 1, you can simply look at the standard normal<br>probability table. To find the area under the curve, the probability, for any<br>normal distribution other than the standard normal, we convert it to a standard<br>normal using the above formula. Approximately 68% of the area under the curve<br>lies between \(\mu-\sigma\) and \(\mu+\sigma\). Approximately 95% of the area<br>under the curve lies between \(\mu-2\sigma\) and \(\mu+2\sigma\). Lastly,<br>approximately 99.73% of the area under the curve lies between \(\mu-3\sigma\)<br>and \(\mu+3\sigma\). <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Combining Independent Random Variables</strong></span><br>Sometimes we are interested in linear combinations of independent random<br>variables. If we know the means and the variances of two random variables, we<br>can determine the means and the variances of a linear combination of these<br>variables. If x and Y are normally distributed, then a linear combination of the<br>two will also be normally distributed. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Sampling Distributions</strong></span><br>A parameter is a numerical measure of a population. for example, a student's GPA<br>is computed using grades from all his courses. GPA is a parameter. <br><br>A statistic is a numerical measure of a sample. An example is the percent of<br>votes received by a presidential candidate. Generally, not every eligible voter<br>votes in an election. Therefore, the president is elected based on the support<br>received from a sample of the eligible voters, so the person is a statistic. If<br>every eligible voter does vote, then the percent of votes received would be a<br>parameter. <br><br>The sampling distribution is the probability distribution of all possible values<br>of a statistic. Different samples of the same size from the same population will<br>result in a different statistic values. Therefore, a statistic is a random<br>variable. Any table, list, graph, or formula giving all possible values a<br>statistic can take  and their corresponding probabilities gives a sampling<br>distribution of that statistic. <br><br>The standard error is the standard deviation of the distribution of a statistic.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Central Limit Theorem</strong></span><br>Regardless of the shape of the distribution of the distribution of the<br>population, if the sample size is large and there is finite variance, then the<br>distribution of the sample means will be approximately normal, with<br>mean\(\mu_{x}=0\) and standard deviation \(\sigma_{x}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\). <br><br>Basically, the central limit theorem tells us that regardless of the shape of<br>the population distribution, as the sample size n increases. Th shape of the<br>distribution of X becomes more symmetric and bell-shaped or more like a normal<br>distribution. The center of the distribution of X remains at \(\mu\). The spread<br>of the distribution of X decreases, and the distribution becomes more peaked.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Independent Events</strong></span><br>Two events, A and B, are independent if the outcome of one event does not<br>affect the probability of the other. In other words, if \(P(A)=P(A)|(B)\) and<br>\(P(B)=P(B)|(A)\) then A and B are independent. Knowing A would not give you<br>any information about B.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Geometric Distribution</strong></span><br>A geometric distribution tells you the probability of having your first success<br>on the kth trial. for example, it can be used to describe the probability of<br>making heads on 4 out of 5 coin flips.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Binomial Distribution</strong></span><br>The binomial distribution tells you the probability of having k successes in n<br>trials. <br><br>The central limit theorem states that if you take a sample of size n from a<br>population with finite variance, and n is large enough, the distribution of<br>sample means will be normally distributed. Even if you are sampling from a<br>skewed distribution like height or income, the distribution of sample means<br>will be normal.<br><br>    </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 3, 2024</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/statistics/">Statistics</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fprobability-distributions-in-statistics-2.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fprobability-distributions-in-statistics-2.html&amp;via=Science%20By%20Jason&amp;text=Probability%20Distributions%20in%20Statistics" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/properties-of-matrices.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Properties of Matrices</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/inverses-of-matrices-in-algebra.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Inverses of Matrices in Algebra </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-09-05T12:56" class="feed__date">September 5, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/working-with-tables-and-graphs-in-statistics.html" class="invert">Working with Tables and Graphs in Statistics</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-08-30T22:13" class="feed__date">August 30, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/what-statistics-is-all-about.html" class="invert">What Statistics Is All About</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-07-11T21:28" class="feed__date">July 11, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/organization-of-data-in-statistics.html" class="invert">Organization of Data in Statistics</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></script></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Jason Moore 2021</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
