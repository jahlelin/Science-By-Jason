<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>When we look up at a night sky, what do we see? With just our eyes we probably<br>see a few thousand objects of varying intensity. They are mostly stars but there<br>are a few planets , comets, and meteors occasionally too. This is just our<br>galaxy. Our galaxy is a very small portion of the universe. </p>

                    <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">This next session is about Linear Inequalities. An inequality is similar to an equation. The difference is that it will not have an equal sign. It will be important to have a good understanding of inequalities because they pop up everywhere.</p>

<p><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/the-evolution-of-stars.html">Stars</a> explode all the time. They do so for a few different reasons. The type of explosions and aftereffects depend on the characteristics of the original star. As you can imagine, there are multiple types of explosions. There are different types of explosions because there are so many different types of stars.</p>

                    <p>You may be trying to display physics equations, biology genes, or chemical formulas.Whichever it is, you realize you have to be super creative to even approach the accuracy that you want. At this point you will probably start asking around or researching the best way to do this. Well let me tell you folks, there is a better way.  This is when most people find out about the wonderful Latex typesetting environment. Read on and I will explain as simply as I can about Latex.</p>
