                    <p>You may be trying to display physics equations, biology genes, or chemical formulas.Whichever it is, you realize you have to be super creative to even approach the accuracy that you want. At this point you will probably start asking around or researching the best way to do this. Well let me tell you folks, there is a better way.  This is when most people find out about the wonderful Latex typesetting environment. Read on and I will explain as simply as I can about Latex.</p>

                    <p>Calculus is a series I have been wanting to do for a while. If you are a student and just starting then your in the right place. This is the very beginning of calculus and where you want to start your learning. Since there are so many topics in school that require some calculus, I felt it was important to get some basics up here for you.</p>

                    <p>Stars live and die in time frames longer than mortals can imagine. In this article, I am going to talk about what happens during the life of a star. From its early beginnings until it runs out of fuel, it will be an interesting journey.</p>

                    <div>Stargazing has always inspired people to wonder what was out there in the night sky. Some thought the stars were past relatives or ghosts. Others thought they were Gods. One thing for sure was that no one knew for sure. From the beginning of time this has been the case. We have always wondered. Even in modern times where we know many things, we still wonder how modern astronomy evolved. As science and technology evolved, our understanding of astronomy has increased steadily though. Stargazing will forever be popular and rightly so. How modern astronomy evolved will forever be a journey to people.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>There are several types of matter in deep space. They range from the huge to very small. Their characteristics are very interesting as well. When we look through a telescope, these areas are very dark. That does not mean it is empty though. There are all sorts of dust, gas, and other molecules hiding in these dark areas.</div>

These all have to do with the trig identities as they are called. Read on for examples on how to solve these problems.</div>
