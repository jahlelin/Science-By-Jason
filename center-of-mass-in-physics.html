Thank you in advance.</a></p><p><br><br>A discussion of the application of the law of conservation of momentum starts<br>with a consideration of the center of mass of a collection of particles. For<br>discrete mass points, the center of mass is defined as:<br><br>\[r_{cm} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i} m_{i} r_{i}\]<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 1</strong></span><br>Calculate the center of mass for a distribution of mass points.<br>20kg at (3,3), 12kg at (-1,-1), and 18kg at (-2,-2)<br><br>Solution:<br>The \(r_{cm}\) form indicates that the calculation is to be done in vector<br>notation, so the units are often left out of calculations involving unit vectors<br>and added at the end.<br>\[r_{cm} = \frac{1}{50}[20(3i+3j) + 18(-2i-2j) + 12(i-j)]\]<br>\[r_{cm} = \frac{1}{50}[36i+12j] = \frac{36}{50}i + \frac{12}{50}j = 0.72i +<br>0.24j\]<br>These mass points act as if all their mass (50kg) were at the point (0.72,<br>0.24). If these Â three masses were placed on a plate of negligible mass, the<br>balance point would be at (0.72, 0.24).<br><br>The law of conservation of momentum can be viewed as a consequence of the<br>statement: the total mass of a collection of particles times the acceleration of<br>the center of mass equals the applied or external force, or the sum of the<br>forces on all the individual component masses. This is a vector equation:<br><br>\[Ma_{cm} = F_{ext}\]<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 2</strong></span><br>For the same collection of masses at the same points, add forces to each mass,<br>and find the resulting acceleration of the center of mass.<br>20 kg at 45 degrees with a force of 30 N at (3,3)<br>18 kg at 180 degrees with a force of 24 N at (-2,-2)<br>12 kg at 270 degrees with a force of 40 N at (-1,-1)<br><br>Solution:<br>Remember, the acceleration of the center of mass is the total mass times the<br>vector sum of all these forces.<br>\[(50kg)a_{cm} = [30(\cos 45)i + 30(\sin 45)j - 24i - 40j]N = (-3i - 19j)N\]<br>\[a_{cm} = (\frac{-3}{50}i - \frac{19}{50}j) m/s^2\]<br><br>If the preceding statement \(F_{ext}=ma_{cm}\) is viewed as<br>\(F_{ext}=\frac{d}{dt}(mv_{cm}\), then if \(F_{ext}=0\), then \(mv_{cm}\) must<br>be a constant. The derivative of a constant is zero, or viewed graphically, if<br>the curve of \(mv\) versus time is a constant, then the slope is zero.<br><br>Stated another way, for a system with no external forces, the sum of the<br>momentum vectors \(m1v1+m2v2+...\), which add to \(mv_{cm}\) must all add to<br>zero.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 3</strong></span><br>A 5.0 g pellet is compressed against a spring in a gun of mass 300 g. The spring<br>is released and the gun allowed to recoil with no friction as the pellet leaves<br>the gun. If the speed of the recoiling gun is 8.0 m/s, what is the speed of the<br>pellet?<br><br>Solution:<br>The problem is solved by application of the law of conservation of momentum.<br>This law can be applied because there is no external force. Since there is no<br>external force, all the mv's must add to zero.<br><br>\[m_{g}v_{g} = m_{p}v_{p}\]<br>or<br>\[m_{g}v_{g} - m_{p}v_{p} = 0\]<br><br>The conservation of momentum statement on the left is based on the simple<br>observation "bullet goes one way, gun goes the other" while the formal statement<br>that the mv's add to zero is on the right. With a well labeled diagram of the<br>situation, the statement on the left is probably easier to visualize. The<br>momenta are equal and opposite. Putting in the numbers we have :<br><br>\[300g(8.0m/s) = 5.0g*v_{p} \text{ so } v_{p} = 480m/s\]<br><br>As a check, note that the momentum of the gun \(P_{g} = m_{g}v_{g} = 2.4kg*m/s\)<br>and the momentum of the pellet \(P_{p} = m_{p}v_{p} = 2.4kg*m/s\) are<br>numerically equal because they are in the opposite direction, add to zero.<br><br>The energy of each is \(mv^2/2\) or \(p^2/2m\). so for the gun,<br><br>\[KE_{gun} = \frac{(2.4kg*m/s)^2}{(2*0.30kg)} = 9.6j\]<br><br>Performing the same calculation for the pellet:<br><br>\[KE_{pellet} = \frac{(2.4kg*m/s)^2}{(2*0.01kg)} = 288l\]<br><br>The total energy stored in the spring is the sum of these energies.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 4</strong></span><br>Make the pellet gun of previous example fully automatic and capable of firing 10<br>pellets per second. Calculate the force these pellets make on a target where the<br>pellets do not bounce.Â <br><br>Solution:<br>This problem is solved by calculating the average momentum transferred to the<br>target per unit of time. The momentum of each pellet is \(2.4kg*m/s\). The force<br>on the target is calculated from the simple expression:<br><br>\[F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = \frac{10(2.4kg*m/s)}{1.0s} = 24N\]<br><br>The total momentum transferred each second is 10 individual momenta of each<br>pellet.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 5</strong></span><br>A 75 kg hockey player traveling at 12 m/s collides with a 90 kg player<br>traveling, at right angles to the first, at 15 m/s. The players stick together.<br>Find their resulting velocity and direction. Assume the ice surface to be<br>frictionless.Â <br><br>Solution:<br>This problem can be analyzed by conservation of momentum. Calculate the momenta,<br>and draw a vector diagram.<br><br>\[p_{1} = 75kg(12m/s) = 900kg*m/s\]<br>and<br>\[p_{2} = 90kg(15m/s) = 1350kg*m/s\]<br><br>The angle of the two hockey players is from:<br>\[\tan \theta = 1350/900 = 1.5 \text{ or } \theta = 56 \]Â <br>and the resulting momentum is:<br>\[p = \sqrt{1350^2 + 900^2} kg*m/s = 1620kg*m/s\]<br><br>The players move off with velocity:<br>\[v = \frac{P}{m1+m2} = 9.83m/s\]<br>at an angle of 56 degrees to the original direction of the 75 kg player.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 6</strong></span><br>James Bond is skiing along being pursued by Goldfinger, also on skis. Assume no<br>friction. mr. bond, at 100 kg, fires backward a 40 g bullet at 800 m/s.<br>Goldfinger, at 120 kg, fires forward at Bond with a similar weapon. What is the<br>relative velocity change after the exchange of six shots each. No bullets hit<br>bond or Goldfinger.<br><br>Solution:<br>The problem is analyzed with conservation of momentum. The \(m_{b}v_{b}\) of the<br>bullet fired by Bond increases his momentum by \(m_{B} \Delta v_{B}\). Remember<br>that each bullet Bond fires increases his velocity. Set \(m_{b}v_{b} = m_{B}<br>\Delta v_{B}\) and solve for \(\Delta v_{B}\).<br>\[40*10^{-3}kg(800m/s) = (100kg) \Delta v_{B}\]<br>\[\Delta v_{B} = 0.32 m/s\]<br>The \(40*10^{-3}kg\) bullet is small compared to the 100 kg of Bond, and it<br>would not affect the calculation. The \(\Delta v_{B}\) notation is used to<br>indicate that each bullet fired by Bond causes a change in his velocity.Â <br><br>Goldfinger has his momentum decreased. In his case, \(m_{b}v_{b} = m_{G} \Delta<br>v_{G}\). Putting in the numbers:<br>\[32kg*m/s = (120kg) \Delta v_{G}\]<br>\[\Delta v_{G} = 0.26m/s\]<br><br>Bond goes faster and Goldfinger goes slower, with the total change in velocity<br>0.58 m/s for each pair of shots fired. For six shots, this amounts to a<br>difference of 3.48 m/s. If Bond and Goldfinger have been traveling at the same<br>speed, then after this exchange Bond would have a relative speed advantage of<br>3.48 m/s.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 7</strong></span><br>A 3000 kg closed boxcar traveling at 3.0 m/s is overtaken by a 1000 kg open<br>boxcar traveling at 5.0 m/s. The cars couple together. Find the resulting speed<br>of the combination.<br><br>Solution:<br>The momentum before coupling is the same as the momentum after coupling.<br>\[3000kg(3.0m/s) + 1000kg(5.0m/s) = (4000kg)v\]<br>\[v = 3.5 m/s\]<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 8</strong></span><br>Continuing with the previous example, rain falls into the open boxcar so that<br>the mass increases at 1.0 kg/s. What is the velocity of the boxcars at 500 s?<br><br>Solution:<br>The total momentum of the boxcars is 4000kg(3.5m/s)=14000kg*m/s. Assume that<br>there is no horizontal component of the rain to change the momentum in the<br>direction of motion of the boxcars. The mass increases by (1.0kg/s)3.5m/s=500kg.<br>The momentum is a constant, so the new velocity is:<br>\[14000kg*m/s = (4500kg)v_{R}\]<br>\[v_{R} = 3.11 m/s\]<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 9</strong></span><br>For the situation described in the previous problem, what is the rate of change<br>in velocity for the boxcars?<br><br>Solution:<br>This is a very interesting calculus problem that involves taking the total<br>derivative. Since there are no external forces, the total change in mv must<br>equal zero.<br>\[d(mv) = mdv + vdm = 0\]<br>or<br>\[mdv = -vdm\]<br>Now write m as a function of time.<br>\[m = m_{o} + rt = 4000kg + (1.0kg/s)t\]<br>The derivative of m is dm = rdt.<br>Using the two previous equation and rearranging:<br>\[\frac{dv}{v} = -\frac{dm}{m} = -\frac{r}{m_{o}+rt}dt\]<br>Introduce a change of variables:<br>\[u = m_{o} + rt\]<br>with du = rdt<br>\[\frac{dv}{v} = -\frac{du}{u}\]<br>integrating, ln v = -ln u + ln K because it is a convenient form for the<br>constant. Now rearrange:<br>\[ln v + ln u = K\]<br>and:<br>\[ln uv = ln K\]<br>\[uv = K\]<br>Change the variable back to t, so that \((m_{o} + rt)v = k\)<br>Evaluate the constant from the condition that at t=0,<br>\[m_{o} = 14000kg*m/s\]<br>So:<br>\[K = 14000kg*m/s\]<br>The relation between v and t is:<br>\[v = \frac{K}{m_{o} + rt} = \frac{14000kg*m/s}{(4000kg + 1.0kg/s*t)}\]<br>The velocity at t=500s is:<br>\[v_{t=500} = \frac{14000kg*m/s}{4500kg} = 3.11 m/s\]<br>conservation of momentum and a little calculus produce the v versus t relation.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 10</strong></span><br><br>A 3.0 kg cat is in a 24 kg boat. The cat is 10 m from the shore. The cat walks<br>3.0 m toward the shore. How far is the cat from the shore? Assume no friction<br>between boat and water.<br><br>Solution:<br>There are no external forces, so the center of mass of the cat-boat system is<br>constant. Knowing that the center of mass doesn't move is all that is necessary<br>to do this problem.Â <br>Write the center of mass of the cat-boat system before the cat walks. M is the<br>mass of the boat and m is the cat. Then write the center of mass of the cat-boat<br>system after the cat walks.<br>\[x_{cm} = \frac{Mx_{b}+mx_{c}}{M+m}\]<br>Because there are no external forces, the centers of mass are the same, so:<br>\[Mx_{b} + mx_{c} = Mx'_{b} + mx'_{c}\]<br>Watch the algebra, and solve for \(x'_{c}\).Â <br>\[x'_{c} = 10m-3.0m+(x'_{b}-x_{b})\]<br>Now substitute from \(M(x'_{b}-x_{b}) = m(x_{c}-x'_{c}\)<br>\(x'_{c} = 7+(1/8)(10-x'_{c})\) and \(8x'_{c} = 56+(10-x'_{c})\)<br>\[x'_{c} = 7.33m\]<br><br><br></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 24, 2024</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/physics/">Physics</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fcenter-of-mass-in-physics.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fcenter-of-mass-in-physics.html&amp;via=Science%20By%20Jason&amp;text=Center%20of%20Mass%20in%20Physics" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/ellipses-in-algebra.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Ellipses in Algebra</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/hyperbolas-in-algebra.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Hyperbolas in Algebra </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-07-26T19:36" class="feed__date">July 26, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/forces-in-physics.html" class="invert">Forces In Physics</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-07-10T18:03" class="feed__date">July 10, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/projectile-motion-in-physics.html" class="invert">Projectile Motion In Physics</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-05-13T18:47" class="feed__date">May 13, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/falling-body-problems-in-physics.html" class="invert">Falling Body Problems in Physics</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></script></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Jason Moore 2021</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
