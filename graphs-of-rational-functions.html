If 0 is in the<br>domain, find the y-intercept, f(0), and plot it.<br><br>2. Write the function in lowest terms as \(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\) and find the real<br>zeros of the numerator. That is finding the real solution of the equation<br>p(x)=0. These are the x-intercepts of the graph. Determine the behavior of the<br>graph near each x-intercept, using the same procedure as for polynomial<br>functions. Plot each x-intercept and indicate the behavior of the graph.<br><br>3. With the function written in lowest terms, find the real zeros of the<br>equation q(x)=0. These determine the vertical asymptotes of the graph. Graph<br>each vertical asymptote using a dashed line.<br><br>4. Locate any horizontal or oblique asymptotes using the procedure given in the<br>previous section. Graph the asymptotes using a dashed line. Determine the points<br>at which the graph intersects these asymptotes. Plot any such points.<br><br>5. Using the real zeros of the numerator and the denominator of the given<br>equation, divide the x-axis into intervals and determine where the graph is<br>above the x-axis and where it is below the x-axis by choosing a number in each<br>interval and evaluating the function there. Plot the points found.<br><br>6. Analyze the behavior of the graph near each asymptote and indicate this<br>behavior in the graph.<br><br>7. Put all the information together to obtain the graph of the function given.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 1</strong></span><br>Analyze the graph of a rational function<br>\(r(x)=\frac{x-1}{x^2-4}\)<br><br>Solution:<br>1. We factor the numerator and denominator:<br>\(r(x)=\frac{x-1}{(x+2)(x-2)}\)<br>The domain is \({x|x \not=2, x  \not =-2}\)<br>The y-intercept is \(r(0)=\frac{-1}{-4} = \frac{1}{4}\)<br>Plot the point \(0,\frac{1}{4}\)<br><br>2. Now that r is in lowest terms, the real zeros of the numerator satisfies the<br>equation x-1=0. The only x-intercept is 1.<br>Near 1: \(r(x)=\frac{x-1}{(x+2)(x-2)} = \frac{x-1}{(1+2)(1-2} =<br>\frac-{1}{3}(x-1)\)<br>Plot the point (1,0) and indicate a line with slope \(-\frac{1}{3}\) there.<br><br>3. R is in lowest terms. The real zeros of the denominator are the real<br>solutions of the equation (x+2)(x-2)=0, so -2 and 2. The graph of r has two<br>vertical asymptotes, the lines x=2 and x=-2. Graph each of these asymptotes<br>using dashed lines.<br><br>4. The degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, so r<br>is proper and the line y=0 (the x axis) is a horizontal asymptote of the graph.<br>Indicate this line by graphing y=0 using a dashed line. To determine if the<br>graph of r intersects the horizontal asymptote, we solve the equation r(x)=0.<br>\(\frac{x-1}{x^2-4}=0\)<br>\(x-1=0 &gt;&gt; x=1\)<br>The only solution is x=1. so the graph of r intersects the horizontal asymptote<br>at (1,0). We have already plotted this point.<br><br>5. The zero of the denominator, 1, and the zeros of the denominator, -2 and 2,<br>divide the x-axis into 4 intervals. Pick a point from each interval and solve<br>r(x). If the solution is negative then it is below the x-axis and if it is<br>positive then it is above the x-axis. <br><br>6. Next, we determine the behavior of the graph near the asymptotes.<br>   A. Since the x-axis is a horizontal asymptote and the graph lies below the<br>   x-axis for x&lt;-2, we can sketch a portion of the graph by placing a small<br>   arrow to the far left and under the x-axis.<br>   B. Since the line x=-2 is a vertical asymptote and the graph lies below the<br>   x-axis for x&lt;-2, we continue by placing an arrow well below the x-axis and<br>   approaching the line x=-2 on the left.<br>   C. Since the graph is above the x-axis for -2&lt;x&lt;1 and x=-2 is a vertical<br>   asymptote, the graph will continue on the right of x=-2 at the top.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 2</strong></span><br>Analyze the graph of a rational function<br>\(r(x)=\frac{x^2-1}{x}\)<br><br>Solution:<br>1. The domain of r is \({x|x\not=0}\). Because x cannot equal 0, there is not<br>y-intercept. Now factor r to obtain \(r(x)=\frac{(x+1)(x-1)}{x}\)<br><br>2. R is in lowest terms. Solving the equation r(x)=0, we find the graph has two<br>x-intercepts, -1 and 1.<br>Near -1: \(r(x)=\frac{(x+1)(x-1)}{x} = \frac{(x+1)(-1-1)}{-1} = 2(x+1)\)<br>Near 1: \(r(x)=\frac{(x+1)(x-1)}{x} = \frac{(1+1)(x-1)}{1} = 2(x-1)\)<br>Plot the point (-1,0) and indicate a line with slope 2 there. Plot the point<br>(1,0) and indicate a line with slope 2 there.<br><br>3. R is in lowest terms, so the graph of r has the line x=0 (the y-axis) as a<br>vertical asymptote. Graph x=0 using a dashed line.<br><br>4. The rational function r is improper, since the degree of the numerator, 2, is<br>larger than the degree of the denominator, 1. To find any horizontal or oblique<br>asymptotes, use long division. There is no solution so the graph of r does not<br>intersect the line y=x.<br><br>5. The zeros of the numerator are -1 and 1. The zero of the denominator is 0. We<br>use these values to divide the x-axis into four intervals. Pick a value in each<br>interval and solve for r(x). If the value is negative then the point is below<br>the x-axis. If the point is positive then the point is above the x-axis. <br><br>6. Since the graph of r is below the x-axis for x&lt;-1 and is above the x-axis for<br>x&gt;1, the graph of r will approach the line y=x. Since the graph of r is above<br>the x-axis for -1&lt;x&lt;0, the graph of r will approach the vertical asymptote x=0<br>at the top to the left of x=0. Since the graph of r is below the x-axis for<br>0&lt;x&lt;1, the graph of r will approach the vertical asymptote x=0 at the bottom<br>right of x=0.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 3</strong></span><br>Analyze the graph of a rational function<br>\(r(x)=\frac{x^4+1}{x^2}\)<br><br>Solution:<br>1. R is completely factored. The domain of r is \({x|x\not=0}\). There is no<br>y-intercept.<br><br>2. R is in lowest terms. Since \(x^4+1=0\) has no real solutions, there are no<br>x-intercepts.<br><br>3. R is in lowest terms, so x=0 (the y-axis) is a vertical asymptote of r. Graph<br>the line x=0 using dashes.<br><br>4. The rational function r is improper. To find any horizontal or oblique<br>asymptotes, use long division. We find the quotient to be \(x^2\), so the graph<br>has no horizontal or oblique asymptotes. However, the graph of r will approach<br>the graph of \(y=x^2\) as x approaches negative infinity and as x approaches<br>infinity. The graph of r does not intersect \(y=x^2\). Graph \(y=x^2\) using<br>dashes.<br><br>5. The numerator has no zeros, and the denominator has one zero at 0. We divide<br>the x-axis into the two intervals. Plot the points (-1,2) and (1,2).<br><br>6. Since the graph of r is above the x-axis and does not intersect \(y=x^2\), we<br>place arrows above \(y=x^2\). Also, since the graph of r is above the x-axis, it<br>will approach the vertical asymptote x=0 at the top to the left of x=0 and at<br>the top to the right of x=0.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 4</strong></span><br>Analyze the graph of a rational function<br>\(r(x)=\frac{3x^2-3x}{x^2+x-12}\)<br><br>Solution:<br>1. We factor r to get \(r(x)=\frac{3x(x-1)}{(x+4)(x-3)}\). The domain of r is<br>\({x|x\not=-4,x\not=3}\). The y-intercept is r(0)=0. Plot the point (0,0).<br><br>2. R is in lowest terms. Since the real solutions of the equation 3x(x-1)=0 are<br>x=0 and x=1, the graph has two x-intercepts, 0 and 1. We determine the behavior<br>of the graph of r near each x-intercept.<br>Near0:\(r(x)=\frac{3x(x-1)}{(x+4)(x-3)}=\frac{3x(0-1)}{(0+4)(0-3)}=\frac{1}{4}x\)<br>Near1:\(r(x)=\frac{3x(x-1)}{(x+4)(x-3)}=\frac{3(1)(x-1)}{(1+4)(1-3)}=-\frac{3}{10}(x-1)\)<br>Plot the point (0,0) and show a line with slope \(\frac{1}{4}\) there. Plot the<br>point (1,0) and show a line with slope \(-\frac{3}{10}\) there.<br><br>3. R is in lowest terms. Since the real solutions of the equation (x+4)(x-3)=0<br>are x=-4 and x=3, the graph of r has two vertical asymptotes, the lines x=-4 and<br>x=3. Plot these lines using dashes.<br><br>4. Since the degree of the numerator equals the degree of the denominator, the<br>graph has a horizontal asymptote. To find it, we either use long division or<br>form the quotient of the leading coefficient of the numerator, 3, and the<br>leading coefficient of the denominator, 1. The graph of r has the horizontal<br>asymptote y=3. To find out whether the graph of r intersects the asymptote, we<br>solve the equation r(x)=3.<br>\(r(x)=\frac{3x^2-3x}{x^2+x-12}=3\)<br>\(3x^2-3x=3x^2+3x-36\)<br>\(-6x=-36\)<br>\(x=6\)<br>The graph intersects the line y=3 only at x=6, and (6,3) is a point on the graph<br>of r. Plot the point (6,3) and the line y=3 using dashes.<br><br>5. The zeros of the numerator, 0 and 1, and the zeros of the denominator, -4 and<br>3, divide the x-axis into 5 intervals. Choose a number in each interval, solve<br>r(x) for each number chosen. If solution is positive then the point is above the<br>x-axis but if the solution is negative then the point is below the x-axis. <br><br>6. Since the graph of r is above the x-axis for x&lt;-4 and only crosses the line<br>y=3 at (6,3), as x approaches negative infinity the graph of r will approach the<br>horizontal asymptote y=3 from above. The graph of r will approach the vertical<br>asymptote x=-4 at the top to the left of x=-4 and at the bottom to the right of<br>x=-4. The graph of r will approach the vertical asymptote x=3 at the bottom to<br>the left of x=3 and at the top to the right of x=3. We do not know whether the<br>graph of r crosses or touches the line y=3 at (6,3). To see whether the graph<br>crosses or touches the line y=3, we plot an additional point to the right of<br>(6,3) at x=6. Because (6,3) is the only point where the graph of r intersects<br>the asymptote y=3, the graph must approach the line y=3 from below as x<br>approaches infinity. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 5</strong></span><br>Analyze the graph of a rational function with a hole<br><br>Solution:<br>1. We factor r and obtain: \(r(x)=\frac{(2x-1)(x-2)}{x^2-4}\)<br>The domain of r is \({x|x\not=-2,x\not=2}\). The y-intercept is r(0)=-1/2. Plot<br>the point (0,-1/2).<br><br>2. In lowest terms, \(r(x)=\frac{2x-1}{x+2}\) \(x\not=-2\)<br>The graph has one x-intercept: 1/2.<br>Near 1/2: \(r(x)=\frac{2x-1}{x+2} = \frac{2x-1}{\frac{1}{2}+2} = 2/5(2x-1)\)<br>Plot the point (1/2,0) showing a line with slope 4/5.<br><br>3. Look at r in lowest terms. The graph has one vertical asymptote, x=-2, since<br>x+2 is the only factor of the denominator of r(x) in lowest terms. Remember,<br>though, the rational function is undefined at both x=2 and x=-2. Graph the line<br>x=-2 using dashes.<br><br>4. Since the degree of the numerator equals the degree of the denominator, the<br>graph has a horizontal asymptote. To find it, we use long division or form the<br>quotient of the leading coefficient of the numerator 2, and the leading<br>coefficient of the denominator, 1. The graph of r has the horizontal asymptote<br>y=2. Graph the line y=2 using dashes.<br>\(r(x)=\frac{2x-1}{x+2} = 2\)<br>\(2x-1=2(x+2)\)<br>\(2x-1=2x+4\)<br>\(-1=4\) Not a solution. The graph doe snot intersect the line y=2.<br><br>5. Look at the given expression for r. The zeros of the numerator and<br>denominator, -2,1/2, and 2, divide the x-axis into four intervals. Plot these<br>points. <br><br>6. We know the graph of r is above the x-axis for x&lt;-2. We know the graph of r<br>does not intersect the asymptote y=2. Therefore, the graph of r will approach<br>y=2 from above as x approaches negative infinity and will approach the vertical<br>asymptote x=-2 at the top from the left. Since the graph of r is below the<br>x-axis for -2&lt;x&lt;1/2, the graph of r will approach x=-2 at the bottom from the<br>right. Finally, since the graph of r is above the x-axis for x&gt;1/2 and does not<br>intersect the horizontal asymptote y=2, the graph of r will approach y=2 from below as x approaches infinity.<br><br>The real zeros of the denominator of a rational function give rise to either<br>vertical asymptotes or holes on the graph. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 6</strong></span><br>Constructing a rational function from its graph<br><br>Solution:<br>The numerator of a rational function in lowest terms determines the x-intercepts<br>of its graph. This graph has x-intercepts -2(even multiplicity, graph touches<br>the x-axis) and 5(odd multiplicity, graph crosses the x-axis). So one<br>possibility for the numerator is \(p(x)=(x+2)^2(x-5)\). <br><br>The denominator of a rational function in lowest terms determines the vertical<br>asymptotes of its graph. The vertical asymptotes of the graph are x=-5 and x=2.<br>Since r(x) approaches infinity to the left of x=-5 and r(x) approaches negative<br>infinity to the right of x=-5, then x+5 is a factor of odd multiplicity in q(x).<br>Also, because r(x) approaches negative infinity on both sides of x=2, then x-2<br>is a factor of even multiplicity in q(x). A possibility for the denominator is<br>\(q(x)=(x+5)(x-2)^2\). So far, we have:<br>\(r(x)=\frac{(x+2)^2(x-5)}{(x+5)(x-2)^2}\).<br><br>The horizontal asymptote of the graph is y=2, so we know that the degree of the<br>numerator must equal the degree of the denominator and the quotient of leading<br>coefficients must 2/1. This leads to:<br>\(r(x)=\frac{2(x+2)^2(x-5)}{(x+5)(x-2)^2}\)<br><br><br></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 22, 2024</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/precalculus/">mathematics</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fgraphs-of-rational-functions.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fgraphs-of-rational-functions.html&amp;via=Science%20By%20Jason&amp;text=Graphs%20of%20Rational%20Functions" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/properties-of-rational-functions-in-precalculus.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Properties of Rational Functions in Precalculus</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/polynomial-inequalities.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Polynomial Inequalities </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-08-20T14:36" class="feed__date">August 20, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/properties-of-rational-functions-in-precalculus.html" class="invert">Properties of Rational Functions in Precalculus</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-08-16T14:00" class="feed__date">August 16, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/polynomial-functions-and-models.html" class="invert">Polynomial Functions and Models</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-08-12T19:22" class="feed__date">August 12, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/inequalities-with-quadratic-functions.html" class="invert">Inequalities with Quadratic Functions</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></script></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Jason Moore 2021</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
