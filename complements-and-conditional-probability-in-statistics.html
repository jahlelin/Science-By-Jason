The complement of getting at least one particular event is that you get no occurrences of that event.</span></p><p class="align-center"> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding the probability of getting at least one of some event:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let A = getting at least one of some event.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then \(/bar{A}\) = getting none of the event being considered.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find \(P(/bar{A})\) = probability that event A does not occur.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subtract the result from 1.</span></li></ol><p class="align-center"> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Conditional Probability</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A conditional probability of an event is a probability obtained with the additional information that some other event has already occurred.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[P(B | A)\] denotes the conditional probability of event B occurring, given that event A has already occurred.</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Intuitive Approach For Finding P(B|A)</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conditional probability of B occurring given that A has occurred can be found by assuming that event A has occurred and then calculating the probability that event B will occur.</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Formal Approach For Finding P(B|A)</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The probability P(B|A) can be found by dividing the probability of events A and B both occurring by the probability of event A.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[P(B|A)=\frac{P(A \text{and} B)}{P(A)}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The preceding formula is a formal expression of conditional probability, but blind use of formulas is not recommended. The intuitive approach is recommended.</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Bayes’ Theorem</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance and usefulness of bayes’ Theorem is that it can be used with sequential events, whereby new additional information is obtained for a subsequent event, and that new information is used to revise the probability of the initial event. In this context, the terms prior probability and posterior probability are commonly used.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A prior probability is an initial probability value originally obtained before any additional information is obtained.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A posterior probability is a probability value that has been revised by using additional information that is later obtained</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Multiplication Counting Rule</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The multiplication counting rule is used to find the total number of possibilities from some sequence of events. For a sequence of events in which the first event can occur n ways, the second event can occur n2 ways and so on, the total number of outcomes is n1*n2*n3….</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Factorial Rule</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The factorial rule is used to find the total number of ways that n different items can be rearranged. The factorial rule uses the following notation. The factorial symbol(!) denotes the product of decreasing positive whole numbers. The factorial rule is stated as the number of different arrangements of n different items when all n of them are selected is n! The factorial rule is based on the principle that the first item may be selected n different ways, the second item may be selected n-1 ways, and so on. This rule is really the multiplication counting rule modified for the elimination of one item on each selection.</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Permutations and Combinations</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When using different counting methods, it is essential to know whether different arrangements of the same items are counted only once or are counted separately. The terms permutations and combinations are standard in this context. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Permutations of items are arrangements in which different sequences of the same items are counted separately.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combinations of items are arrangements in which different sequences of the same items are counted as being the same.</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Permutations Rule</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The permutation rule is used when there are n different items available for selection, we must select r of them without replacement, and the sequence of the items matters. The result is the total number of arrangements that are possible. Remember, rearrangements of the same items are counted as different permutations.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[nP_r=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When n items are all selected without replacement, but some items are identical, the number of possible permutations is found by using the following rule:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!...n_k!}\]</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Combinations Rule</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The combinations rule is used when there are n different items available for selection, only r of them are selected without replacement, and order does not matter. The result is the total number of combinations that are possible. Remember, rearrangements of the same items are considered to be the same combination.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[n_C_r=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}\]</span></p><p class="align-center"><br><br></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find the probability that when a couple has three children, at least one of them is a girl. Assume that boys and girls are equally likely.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For each event there are two possibilities. There are 3 events.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">½*½*½ = ⅛</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1-⅛=⅞</span></p><p class="align-center"> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a certain country, the true probability of a baby being a girl is .509. Among the next six randomly selected births in the country, what is the probability that at least one of them is a girl?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The probability of at least one can be computed using the rule of complements. Let A represent the event that at least one of the next six births is a girl. Use the rule of complements below to find the probability of event A, P(A), where \(\bar{A}\) is the complement of A.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[P(A)=1-P(\bar{A})\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The complement of A, \(\bar{A}), is the event that the next six births are all boys.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since each birth has no effect on any of the other births, the births are all independent events. The probability that the next six births are all boys can be found using the multiplication rule for independent events. The probability of the event can be written as shown below:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is given that the probability of a birth being a boy is .509.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the multiplication rule for independent events to find the probability that the next six births are all boys. The multiplication rule for independent events states that the probability of two independent events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. This can be extended to 6 independent events.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.509*.509*.509*.509*.509*.509 = .017</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then use the rule of complements to find the probability that the couple has at least one girl.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1-.017=.983</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, the probability that the next six randomly selected births will contain at least one girl is .983</span></p><p class="align-center"> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subjects for the next presidential election poll are contacted using telephone numbers in which the last four digits are randomly selected​ (with replacement).

What is the probability that among three randomly selected internet users, at least one is more careful about personal information when using a public wi-fi hotspot? How is the result affected by the additional information that the survey subjects volunteered to respond to?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The probability of at least one can be computed using the rule of complements. The rule of complements states that the following expression is true for events A and \(\bar{A}\), where \(\bar{A}\) indicates that event A did not take place.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[P(A)=1-P(\bar{A})\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identify the event that is the complement of A</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[\bar{A} = \text{none of the internet users are more careful}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To find the probability of the complement, first find the probability that an internet user is not more careful with personal information while using a public wi-fi hotspot.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1-P(is more careful)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1-.072 = .28</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find the probability of the complement using the multiplication rule for independent events, rounding to three decimal places. The multiplication rule for independent events states that the probability of two independent events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. This can be extended to three independent events.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.28 * .28 * .28 = .022</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now use the rule of complements</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1-.022 = .978</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is very possible that this result is not representative of people that use wi-fi</span></p><p class="align-center"> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an experiment, college students were given either four quarters or a $1 bill and they could either keep the money or spend it on gum.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purchased Gum</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kept the Money</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given four quarters     37</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">13</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given $1 bill                11</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">39</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find the probability of randomly selecting a student who spent the money, given that the student was given four quarters.</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conditional probability of B occurring given that A has occurred, P(B|A), can be found intuitively by assuming that event A has occurred and then calculating the probability that event B will occur.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More formally, the probability P(B|A) can be found by dividing the probability of events A and B both occurring by the probability of event A.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this case, given four quarters corresponds to event A and spent the money corresponds to event B.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First determine the number of students given four quarters that spent the money</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">37 students</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now calculate the probability</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">37/50=.74</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find the probability of randomly selecting a student who kept the money given that the student was given four quarters.</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recall that 50 students were given four quarters</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identify the number of students given four quarters that kept the money</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">13 students</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now calculate the probability</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">13/50=.26</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that since the students either kept the money or spent the money, these probabilities are complements.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.26=1-.74</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do the preceding results suggest?</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compare the probabilities found in first parts</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spent the money=.74</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kept the money=.26</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since .74..26 P(spent the money | four quarters) has the greater probability</span></p><p class="align-center"><br><br></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The accompanying table shows the results from a test for a certain disease. Find the probability of selecting a subject with a negative test result, given that the subject has the disease. What would be an unfavorable consequence for this error?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">357</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">26</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">18</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1150</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A conditional probability of an event is a probability obtained with the additional information that some other event has already occurred. P(B|A) denotes the conditional probability of event B occurring, given that event A has already occurred.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A is the event which is known to have occurred. The given event is “the individual has the disease”.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">B is the event for which the probability is sought. The event is “the individual tests negative for the disease”.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conditional probability of B given A can be found by assuming that event A has occurred and, working under that assumption, calculating the probability that event B will occur.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, determine the number of individuals who have the disease.
