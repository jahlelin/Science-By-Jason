Independence describes events occurring that do not affect each<br>other's probability while mutually exclusive describes events with no shared<br>outcomes. Though these two relationships mean very different things, they are<br>linked in a way. Suppose we flip a coin. The events heads and tails are clearly<br>mutually exclusive. If you get one, you cannot get the other at the same time. <br><br>That means if you get heads for the flip, you have no chance at getting tails on<br>the same flip. In other words, since there is non shared outcome, getting one<br>outcome makes it impossible to get the other. What this implies is that all<br>mutually exclusive events are never independent, which in turn means that<br>independent events can never be mutually exclusive.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Probability Rules</strong></span><br>Complements: The probability of the complement of an event A is given by<br>\(P(A') = 1-P(A)\)<br><br>Union: Addition rule where the probability of the union of two events A and B is<br>given by \(P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)\). If the events A and B are<br>disjoint, then \(P(A \cap B)=0\) and \(P(A \cup B)=P(A)+(PB)\).<br><br>Intersection multiplication rule: For events A and B defined in a sample space<br>S, \(P(A \cap B)=P(A)*P(B|A)=P(B)*P(A|B)\). If the events A and B are independent<br>of each other, then \(P(A|B)=P(A), P(B|A)=P(B)&lt; and P(A \cap B)=P(A)*P(B)\).<br><br>Conditional Probabilities(Bayes Theorem): The probability of A given B is<br>\(P(A|B)=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}\).<br><br>Independence: Two events A and B are independent if and only if<br>\(P(A \cap B)=P(A)*P(B)\).<br> <br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Random Variables and their Probability</strong></span><br>A variables is a quantity who value varies from subject to subject.<br><br>A probability experiment is an experiment whose possible outcomes may be known<br>but whose exact outcome is a random event and cannot be predicted with certainty<br>in advance. If the outcome of a probability experiment takes a numerical value,<br>then the outcome is a random variable. Random variables are usually denoted<br>using capital letters. Sometimes two or more variables are denoted using the<br>same letter but different subscripts.<br><br>There are two types of random variables, discrete and continuous. <br>A discrete random variable is a quantitative variable that takes a countable<br>number of values. <br><br>Note that between any two possible values of a discrete random variable, there is a countable number of possible values. <br><br>A continuous random variable is a quantitative variable that can take all the<br>possible values in a given range. A person's weight is a good example. A person<br>can weigh 150 pounds or 155 pounds or anything in between. Other examples are:<br>altitude of a plane, amount of rainfall in a city in a day, amount of gasoline<br>pumped into a car's gas tank, weight of a newborn baby, or the amount of water<br>flowing through a dam per hour. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Probability Distributions of Discrete Random Variables</strong></span><br>A probability distribution of a discrete random variable or a discrete<br>probability distribution is a table, list, graph, or formula giving all possible<br>values taken by a random variable and their corresponding probabilities. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Mean of a Discrete Random Variable</strong></span><br>The mean \(\mu\) of a discrete random variable X is also known as the expected<br>value. It is denoted by \(E(X)\) and is computed by multiplying each value of<br>the random variable by its probability and then adding over the sample space.<br>\(\mu_{x} = E(X) = \sum{X}P(X{1})\)<br><br>The variance of a discrete random variable is defined as the sum of the product<br>of squared deviations of the values of the variable from the mean and the<br>corresponding probabilities:<br>\(\sigma^2 = \sum(x_{i}-\mu)^2 P(x_{i})\)<br>Remember that standard deviation is simply the square root of variance. Standard<br>deviation is our expected value for how much any given data point will vary from<br>the mean.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Combinations</strong></span><br>A combination is the number of ways r items can be selected out of n items if<br>the order of selection is not important. It is denoted by \(\frac{n}{r}\), which<br>reads as "no choose r", and is computed as \(\frac{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\)<br><br>For any integer \(n\geq0,n!\) is read as "n factorial" and is computed as \(n! =<br>n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)...(3)(2)(1)\). For example, \(3! = (3)(2)(1) = 6\) and \(5! =<br>(5)(4)(3)(2)(1) = 120\). Note that \(0!=1\) and \(1!=1\).<br><br>Why do we use combinations? We do not care when in the sequence our x successes<br>occur. We just want there to be x successes out of n trials. There are<br>\(\frac{n}{x}\) ways to get x out of n successes.<br><br>P^x is the probability of getting x successes. If the probability of getting one<br>success is p, then the probability of getting two successes is p*p. Similarly,<br>(1-p) must be the probability of not getting a success. The probability of<br>getting one failure is (1-p)*(1-p).<br><br>\(P(A\text{ and }B) = P(A)*P(B)\) if A and B are mutually exclusive.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Binomial Distributions</strong></span><br>One example of a distribution of discrete random variables is the binomial<br>distribution. A binomial distribution occurs in an experiment that possesses the<br>following properties:<br>1. There are n repeated trials of a number fixed in advance<br>2. Each trial has two possible outcomes, known as success and failure.<br>3. All trials are identical and independent, thus the probability for success<br>remains the same for each trial. <br><br>The binomial variable X:<br>X = the number of successes in n trials = 0,1,2,...n<br>\(P(X=x)=\frac{n}{x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}\)<br>Mean of a binomial random variable (how many times do you expect to succeed?)<br>\(\mu=np\)<br>Variance of a binomial random variable (how much do you expect your number of<br>successes to vary from sample to sample):<br>\(\sigma^2 = np(1-p)\)<br><br>Some examples of binomial random variables:<br>1. A quality control inspector takes a random sample of 20 items from a large<br>lot, inspects each item, classifies each as defective or nondefective, and<br>counts the number of defective items in the sample.<br>2. A telephone survey asks 400 area residents, selected at random, whether they<br>support the new gasoline tax increase. The answers are recorded as yes or no.<br>The number of persons answering yes is counted.<br>3. A random sample of families is taken, and for each family with three<br>children, the number of girls out of the three children is recorded.<br>4. A certain medical procedure is performed on 15 patients who are not related<br>to each other. The number of successful procedures is counted.<br>5. A homeowner buys 20 azalea plants from a nursery. The number of plants that<br>survive at the end of the year is counted.<br><br>The shape of the binomial distribution depends on the values of n and p. The<br>distribution spreads from 0 to n. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Geometric Distribution</strong></span><br>Another example of a distribution of discrete random variables is the geometric<br>distribution. The geometric distribution occurs in an experiment where repeated<br>trials possess the following properties:<br>1. There are n repeated trials.<br>2. Each trial has two possible outcomes, success or failure.<br>3. Trials are repeated until a predetermined number of successes is reached.<br>4. All trials are identical and independent, thus the probability for success<br>remains the same for each trial.<br><br>The geometric random variable X:<br>X = the number of trials required to obtain the first success = 0,1,2...<br>P(x trials needed until to obtain the first success is observed) =<br>\((1-p)^{x-1}p\).<br>Mean of the geometric random variable: \(\mu = E(X) = \frac{1}{p}\)<br>Variance of the geometric random variable: \(\sigma^2 = Var(X)=\frac{1-p}{p^2}\)<br><br>Some examples of the geometric random variable:<br>1. A worker opening oysters to look for pearls counts the number of oysters he<br>has to open until he finds the first pearl.<br>2. A supervisor at the end of an assembly line counts the number of nondefective<br>items produced until he finds the first defective one.<br>3. An electrician inspecting cable one yard at a time for defects counts the<br>number of yards he inspects before he finds a defect. <br><br>You can think about the mean of a geometric random variable intuitively. If p<br>gets bigger, the mean number of trials until the first success goes down. If<br>something happens often, it is very unlikely that you will have to wait very<br>long for it to occur. <br><br>In the binomial distribution, the number of trials is fixed, and the number of<br>successes is a random event. In the geometric distribution, the number of<br>successes is fixed, but the number of trials required to get the success is a<br>random event. </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 31, 2024</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/statistics/">Statistics</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fmutually-exclusive-events-in-statistics.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fmutually-exclusive-events-in-statistics.html&amp;via=Science%20By%20Jason&amp;text=Mutually%20Exclusive%20Events%20in%20Statistics" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/real-zeros-of-polynomials.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Real Zeros of Polynomials</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/complex-zeros-in-math.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Complex Zeros in Math </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-09-05T12:56" class="feed__date">September 5, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/working-with-tables-and-graphs-in-statistics.html" class="invert">Working with Tables and Graphs in Statistics</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-08-30T22:13" class="feed__date">August 30, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/what-statistics-is-all-about.html" class="invert">What Statistics Is All About</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-07-11T21:28" class="feed__date">July 11, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/organization-of-data-in-statistics.html" class="invert">Organization of Data in Statistics</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></script></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Jason Moore 2021</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
