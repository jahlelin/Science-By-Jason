It's not for lack of trying though. We are constantly refining our ideas and collecting knowledge. This process started thousands of years ago and I hope it continues for another thousand years. The picture below shows the wondrous nature of this field.</p>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dr92evai1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Science Methods</strong></h3>\n<p>The main reasons for our eventual increase of knowledge were better telescopes and improved scientific methods. Better telescopes allowed us to see stars better and make better judgements. Galileo was the first who really made significant improvements to the telescope. He refined what it did and indeed made it better.  Refracting telescopes were what he used and improved.</p>\n<p>They had their issues though which is why the reflecting telescope was then invented. Reflecting telescopes bypassed the limitations of the refracting telescope. It allowed even further refinement to celestial images of the day. How modern astronomy evolved depended very much on establishing methods to test and review results.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #339966;\">Ask a question</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #339966;\">Form an hypothesis</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #339966;\">Make a prediction</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #339966;\">Test the prediction</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #339966;\">Analyze it</span></li>\n</ul>\n<div> </div>\n<p>That is roughly the scientific method. It never really ends though. You keep making more hypotheses, more tests, and more analyses. This process helped early scientists sort through early ideas.</p>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dr92evai2\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Systems</strong></h3>\n<p>What good were these new devices if we did not use them well? This is where scientific method and the development of systematic observation made good use of the new telescopes we now had.  With a defined set of procedures, science itself progressed more quickly. Why is the scientific method important? For one it formalizes the process. This means that everyone is testing and evaluating observations and results in the same way.</p>\n<p>It was important because you could eliminate things that did not make sense and gain an interesting answer much quicker than just guessing your way through it. That is my analysis anyway. With a system of observation now in place, everyone could make assertions based off equal conditions. If done correctly, there should be no outlandish results. Everything that was then inferred had at least a chance of being correct until more testing and observation was done.</p>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dr92evai3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Better Telescopes</strong></h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4474 size-full\" title=\"how modern astronomy evolved\" src=\"file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/telescope1.gif\" alt=\"how modern astronomy evolved\" width=\"558\" height=\"650\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-how-telescopes-are-used/\">Telescopes</a> have not been around for very long. There are many claims for earlier telescopes but even then the 1500's is the earliest it could have appeared. Galileo developed the first good one it seems. It used concave lenses. He used it to start observing various planets and other objects in the night sky.</p>\n<p>This happened around 1609 and was the turning point for Astronomy. He continued to improve his designs throughout his career.<br>Johannes Kepler again made another great improvement by using a convex lens. This greatly magnified objects in space. Switching to this style also gave him a much larger field of view.</p>\n<p>This was very helpful. His telescopes suffered from light distortion which today is called chromatic aberration.<br>Johannus Hevelius wanted to construct longer telescopes because he theorized that the longer they were the sharper they would be. It was reported that he developed one that was 140 feet long! The telescope was impractical to use much because it kept moving.</p>\n<p>Isaac Newton developed the first reflector telescope using a mirror and a combination of lenses. This was a huge discovery. There were still problems but viewing instruments were getting better.</p>\n<p>Sir William Herschel was the great Astronomer who built a huge reflector telescope with a 4 foot mirror in it. The advantage of this is that it could gather much more light. This helped resolve pictures much more clearly.</p>\n<div> </div>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dr92evai4\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Heliocentrism</strong></h3>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-25 size-large\" title=\"how modern astronomy evolved\" src=\"file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/sun_nustar_2016-1024x520.jpg\" alt=\"how modern astronomy evolved\" width=\"1024\" height=\"520\"></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong> </strong>This led to the heliocentric view of our galaxy.  This idea contrasted greatly with the predominant view of most people. Most, since anyone thought about it, thought that our own planet was the center of our galaxy and all there was.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>While we know this is wrong today, you can not really blame those who first thought it.This earth was all that was understood and that was just on a basic level. Because of that, it took a long time for people to accept that everything in our galaxy would revolve around the <a href=\"http://sciencebyjason.com/star-classifications-life-cycles/\">Sun</a>. It was just too new of a concept and something that very few could understand.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>How modern astronomy evolved , though , would have to lead us toward heliocentrism eventually anyway. Our little earth and many other heavenly bodies have some kind of orbit around the star that is our sun.You would think that the life-giving light and radiation from the Sun would make it seem more important to our ancestors.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Indeed, not many made this connection. Nicolaus Copernicus was one of the very few. He was the most influential man in Astronomy. He read a lot of history books and anything on Astronomy. After he proposed his heliocentric view of the solar system he became very unpopular. No one believed in this new system.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>However, the math that he and many others had been working on suddenly worked out when you considered the Sun at the center of our solar system. He published his theories a year before his death. He did this in case there was major backlash with the church. There would be of course.His heliocentric theory was revolutionary even after all the troubles it caused himself and others. We now know it to be accurate and was the key to finding more planets in our <a href=\"http://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-the-solar-system/\">solar system</a>.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dr92evai5\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Celestial Mechanics</strong></h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4475 size-full\" title=\"how modern astronomy evolved\" src=\"file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/cm1.gif\" alt=\"how modern astronomy evolved\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This topic deals with how the many objects, <a href=\"https://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-the-stars.html\">stars</a> for example, in our solar system and how they are affected by other celestial bodies. This really confused people for literally ages. First, without the idea of heliocentrism mentioned above, these principles could not even begin to take off. If you think about the words, celestial mechanics, it really how it sounds. It is the mechanics that we know and love applied to celestial objects.</p>\n<p>Celestial mechanics is ultimately the doing of Johannes Kepler. His laws of planetary motion were instrumental in explaining the motion of celestial bodies. This motion showed how everything interacted with each other. The key equation behind these laws of his was:<br>\\(F = \\frac{G*m1*m2}{r^2}\\)</p>\n<p>It described the gravitational force that any two particular objects exerted on each other. This equation therefore says that the masses of those objects are multiplied together along with the gravitational constant. Then divide this figure by the square of the distance between the two bodies.</p>\n<p>When we use this equation on all of the planets, moons, and other objects, we then see a better picture of what is going on in our solar system.<br>Now Newton had his theories about celestial mechanics but it was Kepler that solidified everything that they knew in that time.</p>\n<p>This theory made it know that the Sun was the major force in the solar system. All other objects of any significant size acted upon everything else too. If the effect was too small then the effect would not be measurable. When all of this was taken into account it made it easy to predict planets and their locations during orbits.</p>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dr92evai6\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Gravity</strong></h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4476 size-full\" title=\"how modern astronomy evolved\" src=\"file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/gravity1.jpg\" alt=\"how modern astronomy evolved\" width=\"600\" height=\"420\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div>The laws of gravity were the next huge accomplishment. They spurred great innovations and knowledge about how bodies in space interact with each other. You see, everything in space has some effect on something else. It can be a very minor effect like causing a slight wobble as something passes by. A more prominent example would be our Earth keeping the <a href=\"http://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-the-moon/\">Moon</a> close by which is due to gravity as well.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>It can also be a huge effect like bringing the object into orbit because it got too close.Even objects that get taken into orbit of a larger mass slightly effect that larger mass. I will say it again, everything in space affects something else to some degree. This is because of gravity.You might then ask what exactly is gravity?</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Well we are still working on that. There are many ideas of course. Newton said it was a force and that every object in the universe has an attraction on everything else. The masses of any 2 objects you select and their respective distances apart will tell you what force is applied on each.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Unless at least one of the objects are very large, however, the effects are so slight you will not notice.So telling the pretty girl sitting next to you that the closer we get the more attraction we will have for each other will probably not work. I know, I tried it once during high school. She did not look convinced.Gravity has an effect on everything.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>It is part of our daily lives. It always has been. Its effect at the Earth's surface is \\(9.8 \\frac{m}{s^2}\\). The force is one of acceleration. This means that for every \\(s^2\\) our acceleration increases by \\(9.8\\) if we are in free fall. The effect of gravity is also different on every other celestial object in space.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dr92evai7\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Light and Distance</strong></h3>\n<p> </p>\n<div> </div>\n<div><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-26 size-large\" title=\"how modern astronomy evolved\" src=\"file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/ComaCluster_hubble_1280-1-1024x727.jpg\" alt=\"how modern astronomy evolved\" width=\"1024\" height=\"727\"></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div> These developments led us to better understand the speed of light and distances in our galaxy. The speed of light is pretty fast. More accurately, it is the fastest thing we know of for sure. There have been guesses that other things in space might be faster but right now that is all conjecture.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Knowing this speed allowed us to then measure distances to many objects in space.For example you can measure the distance to a comet and then a week later do it again. By doing this you get an idea of how fast it is moving and its direction of movement. See how this is important?</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Now that we can measure distances we begin to understand the vast distances to other planets and stars.  Maybe understand is too much credit but at least we are starting to get an idea. Once astronomers started getting distances for everything and their movements, they realized how much more there was to learn. This opened up many avenues of study.  How modern astronomy evolved led us toward discovering the vast distances in space as you can see below.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dr92evai8\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Spectroscopy</strong></h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4477 size-full\" title=\"how modern astronomy evolved\" src=\"file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/1/spec1.jpg\" alt=\"how modern astronomy evolved\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once a reasonable level of understanding had been gained of the speed of light and distances, astronomers began focusing more on the light being emitted from stars and planets. Just about everything broadcasts some sort of light or <a href=\"http://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-radiation/\">radiation</a>. Looking at this light and analyzing it became huge for inferring a lot of characteristics about stars. Over time scientists of the day realized they could look at different wavelengths of light.</p>\n<p>This development yielded a great deal of additional information. Using a spectroscope, astronomers studied the light captured and could tell how hot the star was and partly what it was even made of. Once it was known how hot it was, you could then infer its age and size based other conditions.</p>\n<p>Knowing what it was made of also helped. Stars with higher compositions of some elements had different characteristics than stars with other compositions.</p>\n<p>This became an important field of study called <a href=\"http://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-spectroscopy/\">spectroscopy</a>.</p>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dr92evai9\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Co</strong><strong>nclu</strong><strong>sion</strong></h3>\n<p>Basically that is where we are now in modern times. There are, of course better technology innovations and telescopes out in space to get more accurate readings. Everything is progressing steadily like it always has. We are gaining insight continually and our understanding of the <a href=\"http://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-guide-to-the-universe/\">universe</a> slowly evolves. Will we ever have a true understanding?</p>\n<p>Probably not but it is seeing and discovering the wonders that is out there that has always kept us trying and hopefully forever will. How modern Astronomy evolved is a fascinating subject. Looking at past developments can also give us clues today.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1dr92eg8u0\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>What are Star Classifications</strong></h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Have you ever wondered about <a href=\"https://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-the-stars.html\">star</a> classifications ? Stars are classified based on their temperature, but started out being based on only their spectra. This classification process started in the 1890s by Edward Pickering at Harvard and was finished in 1901 by Annie Cannon, who worked for Pickering. Cannon reorganized what Pickering started in the classification that we know today. The classification is as follows \"O B A F G K M\" that goes from the hottest stars to the coolest stars. These classifications are further subdivided in categories \"0-9\" where 0 refers to early in that star and 9 refers to a late type of star.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This classification is now called the Harvard Spectral Classification. Type O stars and Type B stars are both blue-white hot stars, but Type O stars are the hottest stars. Type A stars are white stars that give off Balmer absorption lines in early A stars. Type F stars are yellow-white stars. Type G stars are yellow stars like our Sun. Type K stars are cool orange stars, whose spectra is dominated by metal absorption lines. Type M stars are cool red stars, whose spectra is full of molecular absorption lines. The Sun is classified as a Type G2 star with a surface temperature of 5777 Kelvin. These spectral classes also relate to the surface temperatures of the stars.</p>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n\n<p> </p>\n<div> </div>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1dr92eg8u1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram</strong></h1>\n<div>The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, commonly called the H-R diagram, is a diagram that plots the stars luminosity (or brightness) versus their spectral classifications, which relate to their temperature. Another view of this diagram with a description is located at EnchantedLearning.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52\" src=\"file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/Image-233x300.png\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"561\" height=\"722\"></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><img src=\"file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/Image.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n<div>Stars have several luminosity classes: Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V, VI, D. The chart below describes the different classes of luminosity, while the H-R diagram above shows where the different classes are located.</div>\n<br>\n<div>\n<div align=\"left\"><span style=\"color: #352dd9; font-family: Tahoma;\"><strong>This chart is taken from the textbook</strong> <i>An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics </i><strong><span style=\"font-size: small;\">by Bradley Carroll and Dale Ostlie.</span></strong></span></div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1dr92eg8u2\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Life Cycles of Stars</strong></h1>\n<div><strong> </strong></div>\n<div>Stars and their life cycles are produced from the collapse of large clouds of dust within nebulae that are called molecular clouds. This collapse can be initiated by the shock waves of a supernova or by gravity of objects/stars close to the cloud. The collapse of the cloud creates \"protostars,\" which are similar to stars, yet they lack the heat at the core to star the nuclear reactions need for a star. There is quite a bit of math relating to gravity, the velocity of the material around the protostar, and the size of the cloud, but that would be too involved for just an overview of stars. As the protostar collapses the material close to the center flattens into a disk and it becomes even hotter.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>If the protostar does not have enough mass to start the nuclear reaction process, then it will contract because of it's gravity and become a brown dwarf. If the protostar has enough mass for nuclear reactions at the core, then the disk of material will continue to spiral inward. Many young stars can acquire a magnetic field, which trap material and ejects it at the poles. While this is occurring, the star is still collapsing and can go through a period of instability before it becomes a main-sequence star. The star will then stay on the main-sequence for the majority of its life.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>The luminosity and lifetime of the star both depend on the nuclear reactions taking place in the core, which in turn is determined from the mass and composition. All of these factors contribute to star classifications and how they are made.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-53\" src=\"file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/Image2-300x191.png\" alt=\"Image2\" width=\"611\" height=\"389\"></div>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dr92eg8u3\"><strong>Main Sequence</strong></h3>\n<div> Eventually, the main-sequence star will exhaust the hydrogen that causes the nuclear reactions in the core. This causes the star to become unstable and increase in size. The death of a main-sequence star is determined by its mass. Low-mass stars collapse and evolve into black dwarfs. Solar-mass stars become a red giant star, and it becomes more unstable.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>This instability causes the outer layers of the star to blow away, which creates a planetary nebula that has a white dwarf at the center. A white dwarf is a small and dense star with a mass similar to Earth. High-mass stars become supergiant stars, which explode in a supernova. After the supernova, the remains can either form a neutron star or a black hole.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Like everything else related to the life of a star, whether it becomes a neutron star or a black holes depends on its mass as a main-sequence star. Neutron stars are small and very dense, which consist of neutrons. The collisions between these neutrons creates a powerful magnetic field that causes beams to emerge from its poles. A black hole occurs if a star's collapse does not end as a neutron star. This means that the mass of the star going supernova is greater than one that collapses to a neutron star. Black holes have a gravity to them that does not even allow light to escape.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><img src=\"file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/Image(1).png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2224\" height=\"1416\"></div>\n<div> </div>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1dr92eg8u4\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Binary Stars</strong></h1>\n<div><strong> </strong></div>\n<div>A binary star is composed of a system of two stars that are orbiting around a common center of mass. It is thought that a vast majority of stars in the universe are part of a binary system (or an even higher-multiple system). The distance between binary stars and their orbital periods vary greatly. Binary stars are classified by how they are detected. The classification is as follows: optical double, visual binary, astrometric binary, eclipsing binary, spectrum binary, and spectroscopic binary.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Optical doubles are not binary systems, instead they are simply stars that appear along the same line of sight. Visual binaries are binary stars where both stars can be resolved independently and their motion is able to be monitored.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Astrometric binaries are binary systems where one star is considerably brighter than the second star. This means it may not be possible to see both stars, but it can be determined by other methods. Eclipsing binaries are located along our line of sight where the stars periodically pass in front of each other. When one star passes in front of another there is light that is being blocked. Spectrum binaries are systems with two superimposed and observable spectra. These stars must have periodic shifts in the wavelengths of all spectral lines for each star.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><a href=\"http://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-spectroscopy/\">Spectroscopic</a> binaries are systems where there are periodic shifts in the spectral lines that are observable. For these stars if the luminosities are similar, then both spectra will also be noticeable. However, if one star is much more luminous, then only one set of spectral lines will be seen.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-54\" src=\"file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/image3-300x90.jpg\" alt=\"image3\" width=\"700\" height=\"210\"></div>\n<div> </div>\n<p><img src=\"file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/science-by-jason/input/media/posts/4/alberio_visual.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"783\" height=\"236\"></p>\n<div> </div>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1dr92eg8u5\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>\n<div>Stars come in a variety of colors and sizes. They are classified based on their temperatures or spectra. Most processes involved in stars depend on the mass of the star. They have several luminosity classes that range from white dwarfs to very bright supergiants. Most stars spend a majority of their lifetime on the main sequence, which is defined by the star going through nuclear reactions at their core that changes hydrogen into helium.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>The death of stars are mass dependent; they can become planetary nebula with a white dwarf at core, black dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. It is assumed that many stars are part of a binary star system, or an even higher-multiple system. Binary star systems are classified based on how they are discovered, and they could be classified under more than one classification.</div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"post-editor-topbar\"> </div>",

Most of the time we do this unconsciously. However, if we think about it a little more we can use this number behavior to our advantage.</p>\n<p>First, let us look at numbers from a very basic standpoint so we are all on the same page. Numbers can be rational, irrational, natural or integers.</p>\n<p>5 = natural, integer, and rational</p>\n<p>-1.2 = rational</p>\n<p>13/7 = rational</p>\n<p>sqrt -7 = irrational</p>\n<p>-12 = integer and rational</p>\n<p>sqrt 16 = natural, integer, and rational because it evaluates to 4.</p>\n<p>These definitions will help us later on when dealing with certain mathematical situations. Each type of number I have listed above has certain rules about what can be done with them. It is these rules that dictate how we interact with problems to solve them. From here on I will give some basic examples of these points to cement them in your heads.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1eehhq7pk2\" class=\"align-center\"><strong>Example - Find the average of some amount of numbers.</strong></h3>\n<p>If you have 72 computers with varying numbers on 3 different pallets, how many computers are on each pallet on average?</p>\n<p>This is a nice and easy example to start with. Most of you can instantly recognize that the answer is 24. A few might have to bust out a calculator but you understand how to solve the problem at the very least.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/34//first-look-at-algebra-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"509\" height=\"50\"></p>\n<p>Now lets do another example that many adults don’t know how to do but is simple nonetheless. This one is about calculating percent change in two numbers. I asked a couple people and neither adult knew how to do this off top of their heads. They are both proficient with Excel though. Kind of concerning isn’t it? I think we often rely on our tools too much. In fact, many people can’t do things by hand anymore. That is also the reason why I get asked to help with these things, as these people don’t know why the calculations they do work or don’t work. When something does not give the expected results, they can’t debug their own problem to figure out why.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1eehhqtad3\" class=\"align-center\"><strong>Example - Calculate the percent change in these two numbers: 38 and 57.</strong></h3>\n<p>I will explain what we are doing so it is clear. First, we get the difference between the two numbers. 57-38 = 19. We then divide the difference by the lesser number. 19/38 = .5. Multiply the .5 times 100 and that is your percent change. .5 * 100 = 50% change.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/34//a-first-look-at-algebra-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"103\"></p>\n<p>If you notice, I am going over some common tasks that everyone should know how to do. I am trying to explain how they work also. Another problem someone might be curious about is how fast the Earth moves. So lets work on this.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1eehhr9d84\" class=\"align-center\"><strong>Example - Calculate the speed of Earth in its orbit.</strong></h3>\n<p>Let’s think about what we know. Its orbit is the elliptical path it takes around the Sun. An elliptical path is a very stretched out circle in simple terms. The Earth goes around the Sun because of the Sun’s gravitational pull. We also know that the average radius of our orbital path is 93 million miles. The Earth also takes approximately 1 year to travel this path. We will use this simple geometry to figure out the rest of what we need.</p>\n<p>Speed is distance divided by time. Our first task is to find out how far we travel in a year. How many miles is it really? We want to use the formula for a circle here because it’s a fair approximation. The distance around a circle is 2* pi * r.</p>\n<p>D = 2 * 3.14 * 93,000,000 which is rounded to 584,000,000 miles. Hours in a year = 365 * 24 = 8760.</p>\n<p>We have our problem data now so just divide. 584,000,000 / 8760 = 67,000 miles per hour. I rounded that up. That is how fast we are traveling around the Sun.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/34//a-first-look-at-algebra-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"96\"></p>\n<p>Another good ability to have is to be able to calculate the volume of common objects. This is handy in cooking, 3d printing, and estimating the mass of stellar objects 50 billion light years away. Fun right! So what would the volume be of a simple soda can?</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1eehhsghs5\" class=\"align-center\"><strong>Example - Find the volume of the infamous soda can!</strong></h3>\n<p>This soft drink is a cylinder. That is its shape.The formula for the volume of a cylinder is v = pi * r^2 * h. V = volume, pi = 3.14, r = radius, and h = height. If r = 1.4 inches and and h = 5 inches, use these figures to find the volume.</p>\n<p>V = (3.14) * (1.4)^2 * (5).</p>\n<p>V = 30.78 cubic inches.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/34//a-first-look-at-algebra-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"51\"></p>\n<p>Another good tool to have in your mental repertoire is being able to measure the thickness of objects through basic calculations.It’s actually a pretty quick calculation once you understand it. Lets try it out.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1eehhss5n6\" class=\"align-center\"><strong>Example - What is the thickness of an object that is 15 cm by 35 cm and weighs 5.4 grams?</strong></h3>\n<p>Thickness = volume / area. 1 cubic cm of this material weighs 2.7 grams. We start by finding the volume. Volume in this case will be length * width * thickness.</p>\n<p>We know the material weighs a total of 5.4 grams and also that 1 cubic cm is equal to 2.7 grams. So that means we have 2 cubic cm of material, which is our volume.</p>\n<p>The area of this material is easy since it seems to be rectangular. 15 cm * 35 cm = 525 cm ^2.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/34//a-first-look-at-algebra-5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"110\"></p>\n<p>Thickness = volume / area. Thickness = 2 cm ^3 / 525 cm ^2. Thickness = .0038 cm. That is our answer. Its pretty thin isn’t it? This process does show you how useful it is to be able to do these calculations. You have to have the correct information up front of course.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1eehhte447\" class=\"align-center\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>\n<p>I am going to stop here for this entry. In this topic I talked about the types of numbers we often see. I hopefully explained why it is important to do calculations by hand at first, until they are understood. We did several examples together and I hope they were able to be understood by my explanations. This will be an ongoing series and I think it will be a lot of fun to learn and teach others. Percy, if you read this far, this one was for you my son!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

Read on if you want to know more.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div></div>\n<div> </div>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e8kqqesr0\"><strong>Where Stars Form</strong></h3>\n<div>Many of the surrounding stars formed billions of years ago. Stars continually form in areas all around us. It is a constant process. Stars form when the gravity of its local medium gets too strenuous. Increased pressure leads to nuclear fusion. There will be <span class=\"pwa-mark pwa-mark-ignored\"       >a new star</span> after this.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Heat and gravitational effects play a large role in star formation. Hot gas implies fast-moving <span class=\"\"       >molecule</span>s. In a very cooperative way, the hot gas balances out the gravity.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e8kqqn2d1\"><strong>Formation Of Stars</strong></h3>\n<div> </div>\n<div><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/33/star-formation-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\"></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>As mentioned earlier, the formation begins when gravity overcomes the effects of heat and pressure. This starts with a dense and cold cloud of gas. These clouds have a decent amount of gravity within themselves. A single cloud can form hundreds of stars.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>There <span class=\"\"       >is</span> still a lot of material in a cloud at this point. It is not very <span class=\"\"       >dens</span>e at this point. The temperature is still cool. The cloud is now losing a lot of its energy into space. That is why the temperature has not increased. It is slowly increasing in density.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>When a cloud has stopped radiating energy, it condenses in size. It is much hotter in its core than at the outside edges. It is also much denser in the middle sections. This construct is now officially a protostar. It will continue to grow and get hotter.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>A protostar is boiling hot. Its core is around 1 million Kelvin. Its luminosity is also dazzling because it is much larger than many mature stars. After <span class=\"\"       >an extensive</span> amount of time, a protostar decreases its size. It has not lost its material, so it has just become very dense. The luminosity has also decreased a lot.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Eventually our protostar has become super dense and hot. Nuclear fusion <span class=\"\"       >begin</span>s, and we now have a complete star. It does a little <span class=\"\"       >mor</span>e contracting, and the density goes up even more.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e8kqr4r92\"><strong>Interstellar Clouds</strong></h3>\n<div> </div>\n<div><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/33/star-formation-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"951\" height=\"600\"></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Observing many objects is how scientists infer <span class=\"\"       >what is going on</span>. They are all seen at different stages in their development. This allows Astronomers to infer what happened. They often look for young stars because emissions give signs about what happened.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>There is slight evidence of fragments found in our galaxy. Some clouds are brightly lit from young stars. From observational evidence, like temperature and density, it seems these clouds are on their way to producing more stars. Radio waves are the key tool in these studies.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>“Winds” from protostars are often very strong. These winds are often a key indicator that a protostar is nearby.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e8kqrf1g3\"><strong>Star Formation</strong></h3>\n<div> </div>\n<div><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/33/star-formation-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\"></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>One characteristic of star formation is the many shock waves involved. These happen when emissions send material flying outward. The material <span class=\"\"       ><span class=\"pwa-mark pwa-mark-ignored\"       >consists</span></span><span class=\"pwa-mark pwa-mark-ignored\"       > of</span> interstellar gas and dust. These shock waves are often the beginning. They will hit a cloud from all directions. <span class=\"pwa-mark pwa-mark-ignored\"       >Portions of the cloud will be divided</span>. This compresses and heats the material inside. Process then start and the separate cloud portions will each make a star. Then eventually a star will be born.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Shock waves come from emissions, supernovae, and planetary nebulae.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e8kqro3a4\"><strong>Star Clusters</strong></h3>\n<div> </div>\n<div><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/33/star-formation-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"436\"></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>As mentioned above, a single cloud will make several stars. It does this because shock waves divide up the cloud. We call this collection of stars a cluster. This makes studying stars in a cluster interesting. The only difference between them will be their mass. This is because they all formed from the same material.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e8kqs0qh5\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>\n<div>Star formation happens when an interstellar cloud collapses under its own gravitational effect. It will break up into several pieces. These pieces are all large. These pieces will become protostars.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>For most mid-size stars, the complete process takes many millions of years. Smaller mass stars take longer to get there but lasts a lot <span class=\"pwa-mark pwa-mark-ignored\"       >longer</span>. Super massive stars go through their whole formation quick and then <span class=\"\"       >en</span>d in an <span class=\"\"       >astro</span>nomical blink of an eye. They usually go out by supernovae.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Radio telescopes are a key tool in studying objects too far away <span class=\"\"       >to</span> see. Protostars are immensely bright and have powerful winds. These winds will <span class=\"\"       >destro</span>y its own disk and eventually cause shock waves. These shock waves will trigger star formation in other sections of the interstellar cloud.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>A cloud can spawn hundreds of stars. A star cluster is the result.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>",

They range from the huge to very small. Their characteristics are very interesting as well. When we look through a telescope, these areas are very dark. That does not mean it is empty though. There are all sorts of dust, gas, and other molecules hiding in these dark areas.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div></div>\n<strong>Matter in Interstellar Space</strong>\n<div>These pockets of dust and gas are found everywhere throughout the universe. There is no rhyme or reason to their location. Some of these are many parsecs wide. This matter between large objects is called the interstellar medium. It contains mostly gas and dust. As you can imagine, both the gas and dust are very small. Even they range in sizes though. Their size depends on their composition. Gas does not really block any radiation, however, dust does a little.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>When starlight dims because of the interstellar medium it is called extinction. What is useful about this is that light can only be absorbed by particles similar in size to the wavelength of the light. This tells us about the source of the light radiation. All this data can help us learn the color and brightness of the source star.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>While pockets of dust and gas are everywhere, the density of them are very low. That means there is not very much dust or gas by normal standards here on Earth. They still block a lot of light though.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Most of the gas is composed of Hydrogen. The rest is a variety of elements very small in proportion. Dust is made up of numerous elements and molecules also. The difference is that the components of dust are much more evenly distributed. There is no foundational element or molecule to make up its composition.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/31/Interstellar-Medium-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1177\" height=\"600\"></div>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e2vp7k3c2\"><strong>Emission Nebulae</strong></h3>\n<div>Emission nebulae are hot molecular clouds that glow with a bright light. More succinctly, these are clouds of dust and gas. Light from stars that are contained within are the usual reason for the glowing effect. The gas glows because it is ionized. Ionized gas is super hot.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>There has to be at least one hot object in a gas cloud in order to ionize surrounding gas. These clouds have a really low density.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Most of the different colors seen in spectra are from electron transitions. Atoms are not left in excited states for very long. Their state changes often and regularly.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e2vp7tlm3\"><strong>Dust Clouds</strong></h3>\n<div>Most of space is relatively empty. There are no stars and so little other matter it might as well be empty. This makes it very cold. Stars will warm an area of space for sure. Without any nearby though and it is absolutely frigid. Areas of space with nothing else nearby is well below freezing.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>These dust clouds can be quite huge. Many are larger than our solar system to give you an idea.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Spectral lines have given us most of our knowledge of these dust clouds. The lines are all different because of the characteristics of the gas in each cloud.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/31/Interstellar-medium-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"633\" height=\"500\"></div>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e2vp86e94\"><strong>21-Centimeter Radiation</strong></h3>\n<div>The methods discussed previously require line of sight through our telescopes. In many cases we will not have any such thing. This also means we can not see dust clouds that are really far away. We can only see the closest ones.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>There is a solution to this problem though. It is called radio emissions.  As you should have learned in chemistry class, all matter tries to get to its lowest energy state. Many objects are temporarily in higher energy states. When an electron changes state to something lower, it releases a photon equal to the difference. This photon can be measured. The energy of this photon is very low which means that its wavelength will be large relatively speaking. The wavelength is 21 centimeters long which puts it in the radio spectrum. All it depends on is that Hydrogen be present. This gas is present in almost all places so this is very helpful.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>This is one of the advantages to radio astronomy. Almost anything can be studied because of this technique. Most other branches of astronomy are more limited because they are optical based.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e2vp8hvh5\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>\n<div>As you can see, the interstellar medium  is found throughout space and occupies large portions of it. Since it is made up of very cold gas we have to have special methods of observing it. Emission nebulas are these same dust clouds that have a hot star in the middle which gives off enough heat to light it up. Through this ionization, the clouds and its matter will glow. The really cold dust clouds can be observed by radio astronomy using the 21 centimeter wavelengths for study.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>",

Instead of talking about how they are unique, I will discuss how they are similar today.Read on if you are interested in finding out more about these incredible objects.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr7aic790\" class=\"align-left\"><strong>Stars Around Us</strong></h2>\n<p><img class=\"post__image align-center\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/29/stars1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"501\" height=\"360\"></p>\n<p>Within our own <a href=\"https://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-the-solar-system.html\">solar system</a> there are untold numbers of <a href=\"https://sciencebyjason.com/what-are-star-classifications-and-their-life-cycles.html\">stars</a>. If you happened to somehow leave our galaxy then the number of stars increases exponentially. So the first thing we want to do is figure out how far away all thesestars are. When we figure out distances to the stars their other properties can also be inferred to a decent degree of accuracy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr7ajdeh1\" class=\"align-left\"><strong>Stellar Parallax</strong></h2>\n<p>Stellar parallax is the degree our view changes when an object is observed from two different points whether from <a href=\"https://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-how-telescopes-are-used.html\">telescope</a> or with our eyes. It is also described as the displacement of a star as seen from Earth. This lets us calculate the distance between us and the object. this is done using angles between the points involved and geometry. The easiest object to practice this on would be our <a href=\"https://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-the-moon.html\">Moon</a>. Distances are measured in arcseconds. The distance an object is away from us that has a parallax of 1 arcsecond is called a parsec, which is slightly over 200,000 AU. An AU is the distance from us to the <a href=\"https://sciencebyjason.com/how-the-sun-works.html\">Sun</a>. Parallax decreases as the distance gets greater so we can use a formula to calculate it.</p>\n<p>$$ distance =\\frac{1}{parallax} $$</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr7ajrdv2\" class=\"align-left\"><strong>Motion of the Stars</strong></h2>\n<p>The stars move. This may not be apparent, especially if you never thought about it before.They move very fast as well by our own standards. They are just so far away it is difficult to notice. They move across our sky a very small amount in a human lifetime. Stars have their own motion as they soar through the sky and they also rotate extremely quick too. Proper motion is how to describe a star's velocity. </p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr7ak5np3\" class=\"align-left\"><strong>Luminosity and Brightness</strong></h2>\n<p>Every star has its own luminous qualities and apparent brightness as seen from Earth. A star’s apparent brightness depends partly on its distance fromEarth. So, the amount of light that reaches us varies inversely as the square of its distance from the source. Therefore, doubling the distance from a star makes it appear 4 times fainter. This means two different stars can appear to have the same brightness. If the brighter star is farther away than a slightly dimmer star then to us they could appear to be the exact same. Remember how we talked about inferring properties of stars once we know a few things about them?This is a good example. If we know a star’s distance through the use of parallax calculations and a particular star is farther away, but appears to have the same brightness, then we know it is inherently brighter and puts off more<a href=\"https://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-radiation.html\"> radiation</a> than the other star.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr7akfrv4\" class=\"align-left\"><strong>Star Temperatures</strong></h2>\n<p>Stars also have their own temperature ranges. Star temperatures can vary greatly. However, we can get an idea of its temperature from the star’s color. This is not very intuitive but red stars are a lot cooler than blue stars. <a href=\"https://sciencebyjason.com/how-modern-astronomy-evolved.html\">Astronomers</a> measure the temperature of a star by taking the brightness at several different frequencies. They then match these readings to a blackbody curve and see where they align. This will give the approximate temperature of the star.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr7al2bb5\" class=\"align-left\"><strong>Spectra of the Stars</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-spectroscopy.html\">Spectroscopy</a> is a very useful tool. I talked about it in a past article and it has many uses. With stars, it is used to collect data on individual stars and then study the differences. The patterns are what tell us the differences and compositions of stars. Spectroscopy is a fascinating subject and can tell us so much just by looking at absorption lines.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr7alc136\" class=\"align-left\"><strong>Stellar Size</strong></h2>\n<p> </p>\n<div>Like their temperatures, stars can be all different sizes as well. However, all stars so far are usually much larger than any discovered <a href=\"https://sciencebyjason.com/planets-of-our-solar-system.html\">planet</a>. The problem, like always, is that they are too far away to directly measure in most cases. So indirect techniques have to be used. The most popular method is using the radiation laws. The radiation that comes from a star is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. This radiation law says that the energy emitted per unit area per unit of time increases as the fourth power of the stars temperature. We know that larger stars give off more radiation than smaller stars. Since this is the case, knowing how much radiation a star gives off gives us a good idea about how large a star is. See how all these pieces fit together?This will let us do an indirect measurement of its size.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr7ancns7\" class=\"align-left\">H-R Diagrams</h2>\n<div class=\"align-left\"> </div>\n<div>\n<div>Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams are used as a way to classify stars once we know some of their attributes. This helps us visually compare many different stars at a time. Most people learn and interpret better using visual methods so this is handy indeed. Typically these diagrams are composed of luminosity and temperature data. Any star can be included in these diagrams if we have its data. What we have learned is that cool stars will be faint and hot stars will be brighter.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr8f50880\"><strong>Mass of Stars</strong></h2>\n<div>A star's mass is one of its fundamental properties. Mass tells us about its internal core and subsequent layers. Its mass is determined by the gravitational pull on nearby objects. Determining the mass of a star can be done in a few different ways. The best methods are studying the orbit and the dipping of the light curves when objects pass in front of it. When looking at an H-R diagram, for instance, we see the masses of stars are grouped very logically. They start at red dwarf stars and end at giant blue stars. Masses range from much smaller compared to our Sun to much larger. </div>\n<div> </div>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr8fdt7b1\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<div>There are several important properties about stars that aid in greater understanding of our <a href=\"https://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-guide-to-the-universe.html\">universe</a>. Finding the distance between us and other stars is an excellent start. Stars have their own velocity even though it is difficult for us to see it from here on Earth. Brightness and apparent magnitude are also useful because those attributes give us an idea of radii.

            "content_html": "<p>Learning to differentiate algebra functions is not hard but involves learning a few rules and some practice. In this article I want to go over these rules which will help you analyze these functions. For each example I also include a graph so you can see what the function is doing visually.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Differentiate Algebra Functions</strong></h2>\n<p>When you want to differentiate algebra functions there are a couple main rules. The most useful and popular is the power rule. It should be used first whenever there is an opportunity as it is the easiest. If the power rule for functions does not apply then go to the chain rule. It is very versatile and uses substitution to do it magic. Another special use for the chain rule is that it can handle any amount of variables. These two rules together can solve most derivative equations. Remember these are also just tools. Whether you are differentiating or integrating later on, learn these useful tools and keep them in your head.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The Power Rule</strong></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/power-rule.html\">power rule</a> is a very used tool when looking for a derivative. Unlike more primitive methods that you might learn first, this is actually a technique you will use often. So lets define what the power rule is and how you use it to differentiate algebra functions. If you have something like this:</p>\n<p>$$ y = x^3  $$</p>\n<p>The derivative of y with respect to x is n(x) and subtract 1 from the exponent. If that sounds confusing, look at it visually. The simple answer would be:</p>\n<p>$$ y = 3x^2 $$</p>\n<p>So what did we do there? Well we have an exponent of 3. We copy that and move it in front of X. So we have 3x. Now subtract 1 from the exponent which is 3-1=2. 2 is now the exponent. Our expression is now just</p>\n<p>$$ 3x^2 $$</p>\n<p>as mentioned above.</p>\n<p>Something I need to mention before I forget. The phrase \"the derivative of y with respect to x\" has its own notation. This is:</p>\n<p>$$ \\frac{dy}{dx} $$</p>\n<p>This means the exact same thing. It is not an expression or fraction either so don't get confused.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The Chain Rule</strong></h2>\n<p>The chain rule is your next tool that you will use often. This is how it is traditionally defined. When y = f(u) and u = f(x) then the derivative is:</p>\n<p>$$ \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{du} * \\frac{du}{dx} $$</p>\n<p>There are two variables here (u and x) but the chain rule can handle any number of variables. This will be handy later on. Lets try some examples now.</p>\n<h2><strong>Example 1</strong></h2>\n<p>Find the derivative of $$ y = x^{3b} $$ .</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4885 size-full\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/28/differentiate-algebra-functions-1.png\" alt=\"differentiate algebra functions \" width=\"1416\" height=\"899\" /></p>\n<p>Ok remember the exponent rules. Bring down the exponent in front of the term and subtract one from the exponent. That gives us:</p>\n<p>$$ \\frac{dy}{dx} = 3b * (x^{3b-1}) $$</p>\n<p>It is just the simple combination of terms as the answer, which is $$ 3bx^{3b-1} $$</p>\n<h2><strong>Example 2</strong></h2>\n<p>Next we want to find the derivative of $$ y = (2x^3 - 5x^2 + 4)^5 $$</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4886\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/28/differentiate-algebra-functions-2-1024x645.png\" alt=\"differentiate algebra functions\" width=\"1024\" height=\"645\" /></p>\n<p>You will see this looks weird but just take it step by step. It is two main parts. It is often explained by taking the outside derivative and then the inside derivative. You can use the power rule each way. So lets do the outside first. That will be:</p>\n<p>$$ 5(2x^3 - 5x^2 + 4)^4 $$ and the inside is $$ 6x^2 -10x $$</p>\n<p>Just combine the two and we will get $$ 5(2x^3 - 5x^2 + 4)^4(6x^2 -10x) $$</p>\n<h2><strong>Example 3</strong></h2>\n<p>Lets try this one now, $$ y = (x^2 + 2)^3 $$</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4887\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/28/differentiate-algebra-functions-3-1024x653.png\" alt=\"differentiate algebra functions \" width=\"1024\" height=\"653\" /></p>\n<p>This is a chain rule again. Take the outside derivative and then the inside derivative. Afterwards, just combine the two expressions.</p>\n<p>$$ 3(x^2 + 2)^2 $$ is the outside and $$ 2x $$ is the inside.</p>\n<p>So our answer is $$ 3(x^2 + 2)^2 (2x) $$</p>\n<h2><strong>Example 4</strong></h2>\n<p>Find the derivative of $$ y = (x^3 - 4)^5 $$</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4888\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/28/differentiate-algebr-functions-4-1024x654.png\" alt=\"differentiate algebra functions\" width=\"1024\" height=\"654\" /></p>\n<p>Take the outside derivative and then the derivative inside.</p>\n<p>$$ \\frac{d}{dx} ((x^3 - 4)^5) * \\frac{d}{dx} (x^3 - 4) $$</p>\n<p>That is the outside * the inside. So after taking the derivatives we get:</p>\n<p>$$ 5(x^3 - 4)^4 (3x^2) $$</p>\n<h2><strong>Example 5</strong></h2>\n<p>Here is another straight forward problem. Find the derivative of $$ y = (2x^2 + 3x)^{10} $$</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4889\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/28/differentiate-algebra-functions-5-1024x650.png\" alt=\"differentiate algebra functions\" width=\"1024\" height=\"650\" /></p>\n<p>Just like the others, take the derivative of the outside and then take derivative of the inside. Combine them after that.</p>\n<p>$$ 10(2x^2 + 3x)^9 (4x + 3) $$</p>\n<p>That should be fairly straight forward by now. No fancy tricks needed.</p>\n<h2><strong>Example 6</strong></h2>\n<p>Find the derivative of $$ y = \\sqrt{2x^3 - 4x + 5} $$</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4890\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/28/differentiate-algebra-functions-6-1024x646.png\" alt=\"differentiate algebra functions\" width=\"1024\" height=\"646\" /></p>\n<p>You can see this is an expression with a square root. A square root is the same as an exponent to the half power. This expression can be rewritten as:</p>\n<p>$$ y = (2x^3 - 4x + 5)^\\frac{1}{2} $$</p>\n<p>Now we just apply the same rules that we are already used to. You will notice that in Calculus, rewriting an expression is sometimes half the battle. You will know certain rules and have tools to deal with certain kinds of expressions but you need them in the right form. So it will be important to recognize when you need to rewrite something to make it work for you.</p>\n<p>We continue like usual. Take the derivative of the outside and then the inside. It looks like this.</p>\n<p>$$ \\frac{1}{2}(2x^3 - 4x + 5)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} (6x^2 - 4) $$</p>\n<h2><strong>Example 7</strong></h2>\n<p>Next, find this derivative. $$ y = \\sqrt{x^2 + 1} $$</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4891\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/28/differentiate-algebra-functions-7-1024x655.png\" alt=\"differentiate algebra functions\" width=\"1024\" height=\"655\" /></p>\n<p>First, we rewrite the problem to get rid of the root expression.</p>\n<p>$$ y = (x^2 + 1)^\\frac{1}{2} $$</p>\n<p>As before, we take the derivative of the outside expression and then take the inside derivative. Then we combine the expressions.</p>\n<p>$$ \\frac{1}{2} (x^2 + 1)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} (2x) $$</p>\n<p>That is our answer.</p>\n<h2><strong>Example 8</strong></h2>\n<p>Find the derivative of $$ y = \\sqrt{3x^2 + 4} $$</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4892\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/28/differentiate-algebra-functions-8-1024x647.png\" alt=\"differentiate algebra functions\" width=\"1024\" height=\"647\" /></p>\n<p>Rewrite the expression to get rid of the root and get an exponent.</p>\n<p>$$ y = (3x^2 + 4)^\\frac{1}{2} $$</p>\n<p>Now we can work with it. Take the outside derivative and then the inside derivative. We get:</p>\n<p>$$ \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 + 4)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} (6x) $$</p>\n<h2><strong>Example 9</strong></h2>\n<p>Find the derivative of $$ y = \\sqrt[3]{4 - t} $$</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4893\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/28/differentiate-algebra-functions-9-1024x650.png\" alt=\"differentiate algebra functions \" width=\"1024\" height=\"650\" /></p>\n<p>This problem is slightly different. You can see it has a cube root. It will follow the same rules as a square root though. The expression is to the 1/3 power. It looks like this.</p>\n<p>$$ y = (4 - t)^\\frac{1}{3} $$</p>\n<p>Now we just use the chain rule like we have been all along. Take the derivative of the outside expression and then the inside derivative.</p>\n<p>$$ y = \\frac{1}{3} (4 - t)^{-\\frac{2}{3}} (-1) $$</p>\n<h2><strong>Example 10</strong></h2>\n<p>Find the derivative of $$ y = \\sqrt[3]{t^3 + 3t + 1} $$</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4894\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/28/differentiate-algebra-functions-10-1024x642.png\" alt=\"differentiate algebra functions \" width=\"1024\" height=\"642\" /></p>\n<p>This is another cube root expression. It will follow the same rules as the other root expressions.</p>\n<p>$$ y = (t^3 + 3t + 1)^\\frac{1}{3} $$</p>\n<p>That should look familiar now. Lets use the chain rule again. Once again its time to take the outside derivative and then the inside derivative.</p>\n<p>$$ y = \\frac{1}{3} (t^3 + 3t +1)^{-\\frac{2}{3}} (3t^2 + 3) $$</p>\n<p>We have a good answer there.</p>\n<h2><strong>Example 11</strong></h2>\n<p>Find the derivative of $$ y = \\frac{1}{4x^3 + 5x^2 - 7x + 8} $$</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4895\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/28/differentiate-algebra-functions-11-1024x652.png\" alt=\"differentiate algebra functions \" width=\"1024\" height=\"652\" /></p>\n<p>You will see everything is in the denominator. I am sure you think this will be real fun! Well it won't be near as bad as you are thinking. Remember what I said earlier about rewriting problems to make it easier for you? This is exactly what we are going to do here.</p>\n<p>Lets start by moving the denominator up to the numerator. We reverse the exponent when we do this. It looks like this.</p>\n<p>$$ y = (4x^3 + 5x^2 - 7x + 8)^{-1} $$</p>\n<p>Now we use the chain rule as before. Take the outside derivative and then combine with the inside derivative. It will look like this.</p>\n<p>$$ y = -1(4x^3 + 5x^2 - 7x + 8)^{-2} (12x^2 + 10x -7) $$</p>\n<p>That is our answer. You could move the expression with the -2 power to the denominator if you wanted but I view that as a formality. Everyone knows you can do that. If you have to give a more precise answer then do that as it will make it easier.</p>\n<h2><strong>Example 12</strong></h2>\n<p>Find the derivative of $$ y = x^3 - 2\\sqrt{3x^2 + 4} $$</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4896\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/28/differentiate-algebra-functions-12-1024x654.png\" alt=\"differentiate algebra functions \" width=\"1024\" height=\"654\" /></p>\n<p>This is another slightly different type of problem. Take it step by step. We will separate the constant from the root and do the other parts as normal. First, take derivative of the first term.</p>\n<p>$$ 3x^2 - 2\\sqrt{3x^2 + 4} $$</p>\n<p>Now lets rewrite the root portion of the problem.</p>\n<p>$$ 3x^2 - (3x^2 + 4)^{\\frac{1}{2}} $$</p>\n<p>It is time for the chain rule now. Take the derivative of the outside portion.</p>\n<p>$$ 3x^2 - \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 + 4)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} $$</p>\n<p>Lets take the derivative of the inside portion now.</p>\n<p>$$ 3x^2 - \\frac{1}{2} (3x^2 + 4)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} (6x) $$</p>\n<p>That will do for an answer. As with all of these problems you can simply further if you need a more precise answer. That is just a reducing exercise so we don't need to do it at this point.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>That is several exercises on how to differentiate algebra functions. Hopefully you feel comfortable with these types of problems now. Remember to rewrite a problem if you need to. There are many times when it makes it easier for you.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this article or found it useful please see my other articles and feel free to share this site with your friends.

            "summary": "<p>In this paper I want to describe how the sun works. I will also comment about its properties and how it affects us here on Earth with its radiation.

            "content_html": "<p>In this paper I want to describe how the sun works. I will also comment about its properties and how it affects us here on Earth with its radiation. Our Sun is a star and is the closest one to us by far. That gives us the opportunity to study it more closely than any other star.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr91g7ho0\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>How The Sun Works</strong></h2>\n<p>I want to start out by saying that our Sun is our only source of heat. Without it, our planet Earth would freeze and us along with it. We would not survive. That is how important this <a href=\"http://sciencebyjason.com/star-classifications-life-cycles/\">star</a> is to our survival. So what is a <a href=\"https://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-the-stars.html\">star</a>? It is a sphere of extremely hot gas. Strong gravity is what helps the Sun hold its shape and keep all this gas in one place. In the center of the Sun are constant nuclear reactions that keep the engine turning.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr91g7ho1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Properties Of The Sun</strong></h2>\n<p>The Sun is quite large by our standards. It's radius was measured to be almost 700,000 kilometers and diameter to be 1,400,000 km. This measurement was made by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_and_Heliospheric_Observatory\">SOHO</a> spacecraft a few years ago. It also rotates just like us here. Rotation is different though according to the location on the Sun. It is faster at the equator than towards its poles. This is called differential rotation. Since its rotation is differential, we can infer that the Sun is not solid and is instead gaseous and fluid. Complete rotation takes about a month. The temperature is pretty hot at around an average 5800 kelvin.</p>\n<p>The Suns's radiation reaches us here on Earth. Its energy is what gives us warmth and allows us to live. Different amounts reach here depending on the location. The equator gets more than our poles. That is because the equator faces the Sun more. Earth is tilted after all. The poles get very little radiation and is why they are so much colder.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr91g7ho2\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Layout Of The Sun</strong></h2>\n<p>The layout of our star has been quite organized by those studying it. It is divided into several regions. Those regions are the photosphere, chromosphere, transition zone, corona, convection zone, radiation zone and its central core. These zones all serve different functions. Studying them will explain how the Sun works and allow greater understanding of our universe.</p>\n<p>The photosphere is what we see when looking toward the Sun. It is also where most of the light comes from. It takes 8 minutes for the Sun's light to reach us here on Earth and it constantly bombards us.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr91g7ho3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Brightness Of The Sun</strong></h2>\n<p>We know that the Sun gives off a lot of radiation. How do we know that? Look at the light during the daytime. Light is the Sun's radiation. Most people do not think about that. We can measure this light as well. There is a solar constant which is the amount of light that hits a given spot of a certain size. At first we thought this was very constant. That is reported anyway. I do not believe it is that constant all the time and that it can vary a lot. When it gets very cold  or hotter than normal for a period of years, this is the Sun being variable. This has happened throughout recorded history and is most likely what is happening instead of global warming due to mankind. A lot of the Sun's light does not even reach us. Only a tiny fraction gets through to us. That is important to realize when you consider our hot days during the summer. Only a very tiny fraction comes through space and past our atmosphere.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr91g7ho4\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Standard Solar Model</strong></h2>\n<p>Since we are not able to directly observe the interior of the Sun we have to make assumptions based off of things we do know. Putting all these assumptions together is called a model. So we have an information model of the Sun that we work from. It comes from a little direct observation and various laws of the universe that are already in place and accepted. Specifically these are the laws of energy, momentum, and mass. Now when physicists put all these things together they are assuming the Sun is a perfect sphere and radiates energy outwardly in an even fashion. The reason this is done is that is because non-uniformity increases the complexity of these problems immensely. Most actually think this is still pretty accurate as well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr91g7ho5\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Hydrostatic Equilibrium</strong></h2>\n<p>As we talk about how the Sun works it is important to know about its hydrostatic equilibrium. What this means is that its pressure and gravitational forces are close to equal most of the time. This is actually one of the reasons we assume that its energy output is fairly equal in all directions. Most stars will also stay in equilibrium too. The reason for this is that these forces self-regulate. If one force gets increased by an external factor it can usually balance itself out. This is also one of the reasons why stars and objects like them can be so long-lasting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr91g7ho6\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Energy Transport Inside The Sun</strong></h2>\n<p>Since the Sun is so hot near its core, collisions between particles happen continually. These collisions carry energy. Now we know that the temperature drops the further from the core that you get. This is important because electrons will stay with their atoms easier. Electrons carry energy in their excited states. You may see a problem by now. How does energy move to the surface and beyond then? The way it moves is by convection. This is how energy escapes the Sun and is very important as to how the Sun works.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr91g7ho7\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Granulated Cells</strong></h2>\n<p>When looking at pictures of the Sun's surface you will see many granulated regions. These are huge areas of intense heat. The granulated regions appear to be different colors. Color is mostly dependent on the temperature of individual cells.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr91g7ho8\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Spectral Lines Of The Sun</strong></h2>\n<p>Spectral lines appear when electrons change states. When doing tests we can use these lines to see the composition of what we are studying. Spectral lines of the Sun can tell us the elements that constitute it. However, these lines also give evidence that the temperature of the Sun decreases as you get away from the photosphere.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr91g7ho9\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Chromosphere</strong></h2>\n<p>This is a region just above the photosphere. It is much dimmer and a little cooler than the photosphere also. The chromosphere spawns solar storms that sends out spicules into the atmosphere. It is approximately 4000 km deep. The temperature of the chromosphere is also unusual because its area around the photosphere is cooler than at the top of the chromosphere. Usually anything gets cooler the further from its core it gets. So this makes the chromosphere of the Sun quite unusual. Shockwaves from the photosphere move into the chromosphere at a high velocity. This helps in heating the surrounding areas.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr91g7hoa\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The Corona</strong></h2>\n<p>The corona is a fascinating region of the Sun's atmosphere. Elements arising from this area are in much different forms than anywhere else. Coronal temperatures are much higher on average than the photosphere even. Temperatures of 3-15 million k are common here. That is extraordinary. Intuition says there must be something else causing the heat instead of just the core. It is not clear what this mechanism is though.</p>\n<p>For all of its heat, it is not very bright. We normally see it during eclipses. Magnetic forces move energy into the corona. This produces its high temperatures. The corona constantly leaks into space with the solar wind carrying its particles far and in most directions at once.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr91g7hob\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Solar Wind</strong></h2>\n<p>The Sun's solar wind is not really a wind in the sense that we know it. It is more akin to a stream of radiation and particles that have been ejected at super high speeds. As far as we know <a href=\"http://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-radiation/\">radiation</a> and particles are ejected outwardly in an even fashion. It all comes from the corona itself because the temperatures are so high there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr91g7hoc\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Magnetism</strong></h2>\n<p>Magnetism is one of my favorite subjects. It is no less interesting or relative when talking about how the Sun works. Our Sun has a very strong magnetic field. Its mechanisms and insides follow the electromagnetic laws. Astronomers do not know where its magnetism is created though. Many are still studying this. If I was to guess I would say the magnetic forces are created constantly. The reason I say this is because the high temperatures separate molecules and atoms into individual particles. When these particles are then moved by the abundant energy all around them, they create magnetic fields. Since temperatures everywhere in the Sun are so hot this happens a lot. That is my take on it. I could be totally off but we will see.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr91g7hod\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Sunspots Within The Sun</strong></h2>\n<p>Sunspots are dark patches that often appear on the Sun's surface. They are quite large, about the size of Earth actually. Sometimes they appear singularly but also in groups. They appear dark because their temperatures are lower than the area around them. When seen up close they have a darker core and a slightly lighter area around the core.</p>\n<p>The sunspots are all on a cycle. Most people think its around 11 years but others think there could be even larger cycles. As we get more data on how the Sun works this will be more evident. What this all means is there are quiet periods and there are raucous times as well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr91g7hoe\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The Magnetic Field</strong></h2>\n<p>Magnetic fields within sunspots are pretty strong. They are much stronger than here on Earth. Since they are so strong, they redirect convection currents. This is what makes the sunspots darker and cooler than surrounding cells. Magnetic fields always have a polarity as well. This means the direction in which the field runs. Currents and particles seem to follow the same direction as the field lines. Sunspots in the northern hemisphere have opposite field directions as those in the southern hemisphere.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr91g7hof\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Cycles Of The Sun</strong></h2>\n<p>This is still in regards to sunspots but it is still key to understanding how the Sun works. <a href=\"http://sciencebyjason.com/how-modern-astronomy-evolved/\">Astronomers</a> have been observing the Sun for hundreds of years. During this time there are a few things they have noticed and passed down to later generations. One of these is that solar sunspots are quite variable and prone to change. Sizes, shapes, and durations of sunspots all change constantly. Our Sun does have a long cycle in which sunspots are more common. It is 22 years. We can further break this down into two 11-year periods though. During each 11-year period the polarities reverse.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr91g7hog\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Solar Flares</strong></h2>\n<p>Solar flares are born of the chaos of changing magnetic fields. They produce incredible amounts of energy. Energy is visible in multiple frequencies so we can study them with x-ray and ultraviolet detectors. They are basically very powerful explosions that occur on the Sun's surface.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr91g7hoh\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>What Powers The Sun</strong></h2>\n<p>Everyone knows the Sun gives off lots of energy. The thing is, it continually does this and has done so for a long time. It is common sense that there must be some renewable source of energy and this mechanism is very efficient. This mechanism is nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusions is when two nuclei are joined together. A third nuclei is then formed. However, this third nuclei is smaller than the two previous nuclei. When this happens energy is created because that missing mass has to go somewhere. This is Einstein's $$ E = mc^2 $$ law. It predicts the energy released when this happens. This is what is constantly happening in the Sun and is fundamental to how the Sun works.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dr91g7hoi\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>Hopefully by now you understand some of the basics of our parent star. There are so many fascinating details to study I could not even include everything. There are also newer but untested ideas being presented constantly. It will be quite interesting indeed to see what ultimately develops. I hope that I have shown how the Sun works to a sufficient degree here. If you have any questions please comment below and I will answer. Have a great day!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

When you put a curve on a graph it will have an infinite number of points between its starting and ending points. If you take any two points on this curve you can draw a straight line to connect them. This straight line might be perfectly flat with respect to the x-axis, go up, or go down.</p>\n<p>The line that we drew will have a certain length according to the points on the graph. Length will equal the number of points on the graph that it moves through then. The line will also have a certain amount of points it moves up or down. This value could be 0, positive, or negative. If you divide this change in y by the change in x you will get the slope of the curve in between those two points. This will be important to remember as we move towards <a href=\"http://sciencebyjason.com/beginning-calculus-problems-with-limits/\">limits</a> eventually.</p>\n<h3>Problem 1</h3>\n<p>Find the slope of the curve at the point (1,5).</p>\n<p>$$ y= 3x^2 -2x +4 $$</p>\n<p>The curve looks like this.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4827\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/26/rate-of-change-0-1-1024x638.png\" alt=\"rate of change 1\" width=\"1024\" height=\"638\" /></p>\n<p>We will use the difference formula to solve basic derivatives for now.</p>\n<p>$$ \\frac{3(x + \\bigtriangleup x)^2 - 2(x + \\bigtriangleup x) + 4 - (3x^2 -2x + 4)}{\\bigtriangleup x} $$</p>\n<p>Lets multiple out these terms.</p>\n<p>$$ \\frac{3x^2 + 6x\\bigtriangleup x + 3(\\bigtriangleup x)^2 -2x - 2\\bigtriangleup x +4 -3x^2 + 2x - 4} {\\bigtriangleup x} $$</p>\n<p>We can simplify this a lot now.</p>\n<p>$$ \\frac{6x\\bigtriangleup x + 3(\\bigtriangleup x)^2 - 2\\bigtriangleup x} {\\bigtriangleup x} $$</p>\n<p>Further reducing this give us:</p>\n<p>$$ 6x + 3\\bigtriangleup x - 2 $$</p>\n<p>This gives us:</p>\n<p>$$ 6x - 2 $$</p>\n<p>Our point we are evaluating is (1,5). The x-value of this point is 1. Substitute 1 for x in what is left of our equation.</p>\n<p>$$ 6(1) - 2 $$</p>\n<p>$$ 4 $$ is our slope at this point and the rate of change on the curve we are given.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Problem 2</strong></h2>\n<p>Find the instantaneous rates of change of :</p>\n<p>$$ y = \\frac{2x}{x + 1} $$</p>\n<p>when x = 2.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4828\" src=\"https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/26/rate-of-change-2-1024x777.png\" alt=\"rate of change 2\" width=\"1024\" height=\"777\" /></p>\n<p>First we need to find:</p>\n<p>$$ \\frac{\\bigtriangleup y}{\\bigtriangleup x} $$</p>\n<p>This basically says to find the change in y over the change in x. However, there is more to solving this.</p>\n<p>What we are really saying is this.</p>\n<p>$$ \\bigtriangleup y = f(x + \\bigtriangleup x) - f(x) $$</p>\n<p>The original problem tells us that:</p>\n<p>$$ y = \\frac{2x}{x + 1} $$</p>\n<p>Remember that  y = f(x) and we are trying to find the change in y. So the change in y is:</p>\n<p>$$ f( x + \\bigtriangleup x) = \\frac{2(x + \\bigtriangleup x)}{x + \\bigtriangleup x + 1} $$</p>\n<p>Now we substitute what we know into this so far.</p>\n<p>$$ \\bigtriangleup y = \\frac{ 2x  + 2\\bigtriangleup x}{x + \\bigtriangleup x + 1} - \\frac{2x}{x + 1} $$</p>\n<p>Lets start by combining the terms:</p>\n<p>$$ \\bigtriangleup y = \\frac{(2x + 2 * \\bigtriangleup x)(x + 1) - 2x (x + \\bigtriangleup x + 1)}{(x + 1)(x + \\bigtriangleup x + 1)} $$</p>\n<p>This of course can be simplified. Look for the terms that cancel.</p>\n<p>$$ \\bigtriangleup y = \\frac{2 * \\bigtriangleup x}{(x \\bigtriangleup x + 1)(x + 1)(\\bigtriangleup x)} $$</p>\n<p>We now get a much better looking version.</p>\n<p>$$ \\frac{2}{(x + \\bigtriangleup x + 1)(x + 1)} $$</p>\n<p>Since this limit is approaching 0 we will try substituting 0 for change the in x value and see what kind of answer we get.</p>\n<p>$$ \\frac{\\bigtriangleup y}{\\bigtriangleup x} = \\frac{2}{(x + 1)^2} $$</p>\n<p>Now substitute 2 for x and see if we get an answer that makes sense.

They can be quite interesting. You can see how the problems start from simple to to slightly harder. You should notice, however, that the calculus portion never gets more difficult. It is the same. What gets harder is the <a href=\"http://www.algebra-class.com/rate-of-change.html\">algebra</a> and how to manipulate the equations that you have to work with. So keep your algebra skills sharp and this is easy stuff. later on <a href=\"http://sciencebyjason.com/one-sided-limits-of-calculus/\">one-sided limits</a> will test your knowledge a bit more but they are really more of the same.
