At this point you will probably start asking around or researching the best way to do this. Well let me tell you folks, there is a better way.  This is when most people find out about the wonderful Latex typesetting environment. Read on and I will explain as simply as I can about Latex.</p>\n",

Even in modern times where we know many things, we still wonder how modern astronomy evolved. As science and technology evolved, our understanding of astronomy has increased steadily though. Stargazing will forever be popular and rightly so. How modern astronomy evolved will forever be a journey to people.</div>\n<div> </div>\n",
