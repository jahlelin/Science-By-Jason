It soon became apparent that not all data meant the same. It was important to have reliable measurements. However, that was often a problem. Measuring things was often a random affair. The devices used were not all made the same either. Many measuring devices were poorly made and inaccurate at first. So measurements will never be perfect. They will not because humans are error prone and the devices we use are as well.</p><p id="mcetoc_1eisaqr8j1" class="align-left"><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Uncertainty</strong></span></p><p>Every device, like a ruler, has a built in amount of uncertainty. It is vital to state this when publishing measurements. It also gives the uncertainty as a percentage. This can help make it clear. It is the ratio of the uncertainty to the measured value, multiplied by 100.</p><p>If we measure a piece of metal to be 6.5 cm long, we can assume it has an uncertainty of .1 cm. To get the percentage of uncertainty we divide:</p><p>\[ \frac{0.1}{6.5} = .015 = 1% \]</p><p id="mcetoc_1eisar3582" class="align-left"><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Significant Figures</strong></span></p><p>This is the number of reliably known digits in a number. Non-zero digits are usually significant. Zeroes vary according to the situation. In basic lab work, you never want to state more precision than you have. This is just inaccuracy. If your measurements have 3 significant digits, then your calculations should have only 3 significant digits. Many people do this, donâ€™t be one of them, please. If you are dealing with numbers that contain different amounts of significant digits, then always use the least amount. Consider the number 12 and 23.4. I use these two numbers in a calculation. The result should have 2 significant figures in it.</p><p id="mcetoc_1eisar9np3" class="align-left"><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Scientific Notation</strong></span></p><p>When you are dealing with numbers that contain many digits it is convenient to use scientific notation. A number like 100,00,000 can be written as \( 1.0 * 10^7 \). This is just a standard way to display numerical values. Another example is the number .00000383. I would write it as \( 3.83 * 10^-6 \).</p><p id="mcetoc_1eisargpl4" class="align-left"><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Derived Quantities</strong></span></p><p>Derived quantities come from the known base quantities. Base quantities are length, time, mass, electric current, temperature, substances, and luminosity. So a derived quantity uses these to form a different unit. Speed uses time and length units, for example.</p><p id="mcetoc_1eisarnuq5" class="align-left"><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Conversion of Units</strong></span></p><p>Anything that we can measure comprises, a number, and the associated unit. Without the unit, the number means nothing. Sometimes there are multiple units involved. When this happens, we must convert to something meaningful to us. Lets convert 15 inches to centimeters. 1 in = 2.54 cm.</p><p>\[ 15 in * \frac{2.54 cm}{in} = 38.1 = 38 cm \]</p><p>You see that the inches cancelled out. This is the trick to knowing if you set it upright. The correct units will cancel out and it will leave you with the one unit that you want.</p><p id="mcetoc_1eisarvoh6" class="align-left"><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 1</strong></span></p><p>We consider the age of the universe to be 14 billion years old. Letâ€™s write this in scientific notation.</p><p>\[ 14,000,000,000Â  = 1.4 * 10^10Â  \]</p><p id="mcetoc_1eisas77v7" class="align-left"><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 2</strong></span></p><p>How many significant figures do the following numbers have? 214, 81.6, and .0086?</p><p>Â 214 = 3 significant digits, 81.6 = 3 significant digits, and .0086 has 2 significant digitsÂ </p><p id="mcetoc_1eisaseat8" class="align-left"><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 3</strong></span></p><p>Write out the following numbers in scientific notation. 21.8, .0068</p><p>Â 21.8 = 2.18 * 10^1 and .0068 = 6.8 8 10^-3Â </p><p>Write out the following number. \( 8.69 * 10^4 \)</p><p>\[ 8.6900 \]</p><p>Â </p><p>This section was about the basics of measurements and uncertainty. When measuring, you must always take into account the uncertainty of your tool. As you state your calculation, give the correct number of significant digits.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1h33k0pi9m" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Vectors</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quantities like mass and temperature are described with a number called a scalar. Other quantities like displacement, velocity, or force have a direction associated with them and are called vectors. When looking at a vector on paper, a vector is an arrow with the length of the arrow representing the number and direction of the vector.Â </span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A vector can be described with a number and an angle, like \( A=19 \angle 25 \deg \). When doing basic math operations, you should use the component form to write vectors. So, if a line were placed with the tail of the vector at the origin of the coordinate system, x and y portions can be calculated like this:</span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( y = 19 \sin 25^{\circ} = 8.02 \)</span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( x = 19 \cos 25^{\circ} =Â  17.21 \)</span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is how you calculate vectors.Â </span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have the x and y vectors, you can calculate the length of the corresponding line by:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( \sqrt{x^{2} + y{2}} \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( \sqrt{8.02^{2} + 17.21^{2}} \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( \sqrt{64.32 + 296.18} \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( \sqrt{360.5} = 19Â  \)</span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To find the original angle we use:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( \theta = \tan^{-1} \frac{y}{x} \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( \theta = \tan^{-1} \frac{8.02}{17.21} \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( \theta = 25^{\circ} \)</span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 1</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write out the components of the vector \( c = 47 \angle 193^{\circ} \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The x component is:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( x = 47 \cos 193^{\circ} = -45.8 \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The y component is:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( y = 47 \sin 193^{\circ} = -10.6 \)</span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of unit vectors simplifies the mathematical operations on vectors. In two dimensions, unit vectors are vectors of unit value and in the +x and +y directions.Â </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the first vector would be written as \( 18.4i + 13.8j \) and the second vector isÂ </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( -45.8i - 10.6j \).</span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can add vectors by adding the individual components. If you have:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( (18.4i + 13.8j) + (-45.8i - 10.6j) \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You just add the individual components together. The combined vector becomes:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( -27.4i + 3.2j \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subtracting vectors can also be done. It is a bit quirky, however. You will use the opposite sign of the second vector.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( (18.4i + 13.8j) - (-45.8i - 10.6j) \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This gives the result of:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( 64.2i + 24.4j \)</span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We should also know how to work backward when given the components. When we do this properly it will give us the length of the vector and its angle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us use the last vector:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( 64.2i + 24.4j \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( V = \sqrt{64.2^{2} + 24.4^{2}} = 68.7 \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( \theta = \tan^{-1}\frac{24.4}{64.2} = 20.8^{\circ} \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When put in vector form:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( V = 68.7 \angle 20.8^{\circ} \)</span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 2</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add the vectors:Â </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(A=13 \angle 50^{\circ}\)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(B=15 \angle -60^{\circ} \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(C=17 \angle 20^{\circ} \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step is to put each vector in its component form.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( A = \sin 50 * 13 = 10 = y \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( A = \cos 50 * 13 = 8.4 = x \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( A = 8.4i + 10.0j \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( B = \sin(-60) * 15 = -13 = y \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( B = \cos(-60) * 15 = 7.5 = x \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( B = 7.5i -13.0j \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( C = \sin 120 * 17 = -8.5 = y \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( C = \cos 120 * 17 = -14.7 = x \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( C = -14.7i -8.5 j \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sum all the iâ€™s and all the jâ€™s. You get:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( 1.2i -11.5j \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is your x and y dimensions</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now use the Pythagorean theorem with those values</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( \sqrt{11.5^{2} + 1.2^{2}} = 11.6 \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That gives you the length of the new vector</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, letâ€™s find the new angle</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use the inverse tangent to do this</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( \tan^{-1} \frac{-11.5}{1.2} = -84^{\circ} \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the new vector is:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( 11.6 \angle -84^{\circ} \)</span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use as many diagrams as possible when doing problems like this. Diagrams help keep your thought processes straight and help prevent silly errors.Â </span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 3</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find the resultant of the two forces \(800(N) \angle 47^{\circ}\) and \(600(N) \angle 140^{\circ}\)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will write out all the calculation steps first, before I actually compute them</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(800 \cos 47^{\circ} = 545.6 \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(800 \sin 47^{\circ} = 585.1 \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(600 \cos 140^{\circ} = -460.0 \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(600 \sin 140^{\circ} = 385.7 \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vector 1 is: \(545.6i + 585.1j\)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vector 2 is: \(-460.0i + 385.7j\)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add the vectors together</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We get:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(85.6i + 970.8j\)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use Pythagorean theorem</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(\sqrt{85.6^{2} + 970.8^{2}}\)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The length of our new vector is:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(= 974.6 \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new angle of our vector is:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(\tan^{-1}\frac{970.8}{85.6} = 85^{\circ} \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(974.6(N) \angle 85^{\circ}\)</span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Scalars</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dot product of two vectors produces a scalar.

Otherwise, use the second definition.</span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1hrad2vdc6" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Kinematics</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The motion of a particle is described by giving position, velocity, and acceleration, usually as a function of time. We start with one dimension. Distance means total distance traveled, while displacement is the actual difference between endpoint and the beginning.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[Velocity = \frac{displacement}{time}\]</span></p><p>and:</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[Acceleration = \frac{v2-v1}{time}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This velocity calculation fits our present definition and is equivalent to drawing a straight line between points on the smooth curve of x versus t. Calculating velocity this way presents a problem, because, depending on the interval, we will get different answers for the velocity. To find the velocity at t=1, we found x at t=1 and x at t=2 and performed the velocity calculation. This is not a good approximation to the velocity at t=1 because the average is between t=1 and t=2. For better approximations, shorten the time interval centered about t=1. Getting it as small as you can will give better results. So, the slope of the straight line tangent to the curve at x=1 represents the velocity at x=1.</span></p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Instantaneous Velocity and Acceleration</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A more versatile definition of velocity is \(\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}\), where the interval \(\Delta t\) is very small and centered about the time where the velocity is desired. This approach leads to a general method for obtaining an expression for velocity that can be evaluated at any point rather than going through the numeric calculation whenever we want a velocity. This definition is stated as the instantaneous velocity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v = \lim\limits_{\Delta t \to \0} = \frac{dx}{dt}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This definition of the derivative is the slope of the tangent to the curve evaluated at the point in question. If we want to find the velocity of any particle traveling according to a polynomial relationship between x and t, all we need is a general technique for finding the slope of the tangent to the polynomial at any point.Â </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The instantaneous acceleration is defined as the value of \(\Delta v / \Delta t\) as \(\Delta t\) approaches zero.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[a = \lim\limits_{\Delta t \to \0} = \frac{dy}{dt}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The instantaneous acceleration is the slope of the tangent to the curve of v versus t. The general expression for the slope of any polynomial of the form \(x = ct^{n}\). The expression for the slope at any point is \(cnt^{n-1}\). Stating this in calculus terms, for any function \(x = ct^{n}\), the derivative of the function is \(cnt^{n-1}\). This can be verified in the case of the parabola by taking successively smaller intervals of \(\Delta t\) and \(\Delta x\) at any point t to verify that the slope at any point is 2t.</span></p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Kinematic Equations of Motion</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kinematic equations of motion are derived under the assumption of constant acceleration. While this may seem at first to be a restriction, there are a large number of problems where the acceleration is constant. The simplest and most obvious are falling body problems, or problems involving bodies falling on or near the surface of the earth where the acceleration due to gravity is a constant.Â </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting with the assumption of constant acceleration, we can write:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[a = \frac{v_f - v_o}{t}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This can be rearranged to this form:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[ta = v_f - v_o \longrightarrow ta + v_o = v_f \longrightarrow v_f = v_o + ta \]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We define the average velocity as:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v_{avg} = \frac{v+ v_o}{2}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We define displacement as:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[x = x_o + v_{avg}t\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can now substitute \(v_{avg}\) with the previous equation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[x = x_o + \frac{v + v_ot}{2}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One more substitution for \(v = v_o+ at\) and we get:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[x= x_o + v_ot + (Â½)at^2\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We now have the four kinematic equations of motion.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v = v_o + at\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[x - x_o = (Â½)(v + v_o)t\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[x - x_o = v_ot + (Â½) at^2\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v^2 = v_o^2 + 2a(x - x_o)\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first three equations relate displacement, velocity, and acceleration in terms of time, while the fourth equation does not contain the time.Â </span></p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 1</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A train starts from rest and moves with constant acceleration.

As time goes on, displacement, velocity, and acceleration will be positive.Â </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, write the equation for the height of the balloon starting from the time when the bottle is dropped.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[x = (-3.0m/s)t + (4.9m/s^{2})t^{2} = (-3.0m/s)(8.0s) + (4.9m/s^{2})(64s^{2}) = 290m\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The height of the balloon when the bottleÂ  was dropped plus the amountÂ  the balloon rose in the 8.0s it took the bottle to reach the ground:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[290m + (3.0m/s)8.0s = 314m\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The velocity on impact :</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v = v_{0} + at = -3.0m/s + (9.8m/s^{2})(8.0s) = 75m/s\]</span></p><p><strong>Â </strong></p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 6</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A parachutist descending at a constant rate of 2.0 m/s drops a smoke canister at a height of 300m.

What was the initial velocity of the second coconut?</span></p><p><strong>Â </strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In problems where there is a time delay, it is usually best to calculate the position, velocity, and acceleration of the first particle at the time when the second particle starts to move. It is possible to do time delay problems with a time differential in one set of equations. The difficulty with this approach is that it is easy to get an algebraic sign wrong. If you say that the time for the second particle is the time for the first particle plus the difference between them, then it is essential that the algebraic sign of the difference be correct. It is much easier to do them, in this slower but inherently more accurate way. First, calculate the state of the first particle when the second one begins moving. Then write the two sets of equations describing the motion with this instant as t=0.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calculate the position and velocity of the first coconut at the end of 1s, the time when the second one starts.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[x = (Â½)at^{2} = (Â½)(9.8m/s^{2})(1.0s)^{2} = 4.9m\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v = at = 9.8m/s^{2}(1.0s) = 9.8m/s\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since position, velocity, and acceleration is positive down, orient the coordinate system for positive down with the origin at the top. At the instant the second coconut is thrown down, the first coconut has position 4.9m, velocity 9.8m/s and acceleration 9.8m/s^{2}.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since both coconuts strike the ground at the same time, use the conditions of the first coconut to find the total time. First, calculate the velocity at impact of the first coconut.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v_{1}^{2} = v_{1o}^{2} + 2a(x_{1}-x_{1o}) = (9.8m/s)^{2} + 2(9.8m/s^{2})(60-4.9)m = 1176m^{2}/s^{2} = 34.3m/s\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time for the second coconut to reach the ground is the same as the time for the first coconut to go from 4.9 m to 60 m or the time for the first coconut to go from 9.8 m/s to 34.3 m/s.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comes from \(v = v_{0} + at\) where the velocity of the first coconut when the second one is thrown down, and v is the velocity of the first coconut at the ground.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[34.3m/s = 9.8 m/s _ (9.8m/s^{2})t = 2.5s\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we have the time for the second coconut to travel the 60 m, we can find its initial velocity from \(x-x_{0}=v_{2o}t + (Â½)at^{2}\) where t is the total time for the second coconut.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[60m = v_{2o}(2.5s) + (4.9m/s^{2}(2.5s)^{2} =11.75m/s\]</span></p><p><strong>Â </strong></p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 8</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A boat is passing under a bridge.

How high does the ball rise above the window?</span></p><p><strong>Â </strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is another example of a question that seems totally unrelated to the information in the problem. When you donâ€™t know where to start and you do not see a clear path to the desired answer, simply start where you can, calculating what you can and hopefully learning enough to answer the specific question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first things we can calculate in this problem is the average velocity at the middle of the window.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v_{avg} = (1.4m/2.0s) = 7.0m/s\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This average velocity is the velocity of the ball on the way up and on the way down at the middle of the window. Add this feature to the problem. With this information, we can use \(v^{2} = v_{o}^{2} + 2ax_{t}\) to find the distance the ball rises above the midpoint of the window.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[(7.0m/s)^{2} = 2(9.8m/s^{2})x_{t} = 2.5m\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the ball rises 2.5-0.7=18 m above the top of the window.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">View the ball as decelerating as it goes up past the window, ands find \(v_{b}\) at the bottom of the window from \(x-x_{o}=v_{o}t+(Â½)at^{2}\).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[1.4m = v_{b}(.20s)-(4.9m/s^{2})(.20s)^{2} = 8.0m/s\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Velocity and displacement are taken as positive, so acceleration is negative.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the distance to maximum height, where velocity is zero, is:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[(8.0m/s)^{2} = 2(9.8m/s^{2})x_{m} = 3.2m\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, the maximum height of the ball above the top of the window is 3.2 m - 1.4 m = 1.8m.</span></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 17, 2024</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/physics/">Physics</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fphysics-essentials.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fphysics-essentials.html&amp;via=Science%20By%20Jason&amp;text=Basics%20of%20Physics" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/linear-functions-in-algebra.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Linear Functions In Algebra</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/neutron-stars-and-black-holes.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Neutron Stars and Black Holes </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-07-10T18:03" class="feed__date">July 10, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/projectile-motion-in-physics.html" class="invert">Projectile Motion In Physics</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-05-13T18:47" class="feed__date">May 13, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/falling-body-problems-in-physics.html" class="invert">Falling Body Problems in Physics</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-04-12T18:20" class="feed__date">April 12, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/kinematics-in-physics.html" class="invert">Kinematics in Physics</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></script></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Jason Moore 2021</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
