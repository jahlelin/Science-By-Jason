It soon became apparent that not all data meant the same. It was important to have reliable measurements. However, that was often a problem. Measuring things was often a random affair. The devices used were not all made the same either. Many measuring devices were poorly made and inaccurate at first. So measurements will never be perfect. They will not because humans are error prone and the devices we use are as well.</p><p id="mcetoc_1eisaqr8j1" class="align-left"><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Uncertainty</strong></span></p><p>Every device, like a ruler, has a built in amount of uncertainty. It is vital to state this when publishing measurements. It also gives the uncertainty as a percentage. This can help make it clear. It is the ratio of the uncertainty to the measured value, multiplied by 100.</p><p>If we measure a piece of metal to be 6.5 cm long, we can assume it has an uncertainty of .1 cm. To get the percentage of uncertainty we divide:</p><p>\[ \frac{0.1}{6.5} = .015 = 1% \]</p><p id="mcetoc_1eisar3582" class="align-left"><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Significant Figures</strong></span></p><p>This is the number of reliably known digits in a number. Non-zero digits are usually significant. Zeroes vary according to the situation. In basic lab work, you never want to state more precision than you have. This is just inaccuracy. If your measurements have 3 significant digits, then your calculations should have only 3 significant digits. Many people do this, donâ€™t be one of them, please. If you are dealing with numbers that contain different amounts of significant digits, then always use the least amount. Consider the number 12 and 23.4. I use these two numbers in a calculation. The result should have 2 significant figures in it.</p><p id="mcetoc_1eisar9np3" class="align-left"><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Scientific Notation</strong></span></p><p>When you are dealing with numbers that contain many digits it is convenient to use scientific notation. A number like 100,00,000 can be written as \( 1.0 * 10^7 \). This is just a standard way to display numerical values. Another example is the number .00000383. I would write it as \( 3.83 * 10^-6 \).</p><p id="mcetoc_1eisargpl4" class="align-left"><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Derived Quantities</strong></span></p><p>Derived quantities come from the known base quantities. Base quantities are length, time, mass, electric current, temperature, substances, and luminosity. So a derived quantity uses these to form a different unit. Speed uses time and length units, for example.</p><p id="mcetoc_1eisarnuq5" class="align-left"><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Conversion of Units</strong></span></p><p>Anything that we can measure comprises, a number, and the associated unit. Without the unit, the number means nothing. Sometimes there are multiple units involved. When this happens, we must convert to something meaningful to us. Lets convert 15 inches to centimeters. 1 in = 2.54 cm.</p><p>\[ 15 in * \frac{2.54 cm}{in} = 38.1 = 38 cm \]</p><p>You see that the inches cancelled out. This is the trick to knowing if you set it upright. The correct units will cancel out and it will leave you with the one unit that you want.</p><p id="mcetoc_1eisarvoh6" class="align-left"><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 1</strong></span></p><p>We consider the age of the universe to be 14 billion years old. Letâ€™s write this in scientific notation.</p><p>\[ 14,000,000,000Â  = 1.4 * 10^10Â  \]</p><p id="mcetoc_1eisas77v7" class="align-left"><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 2</strong></span></p><p>How many significant figures do the following numbers have? 214, 81.6, and .0086?</p><p>Â 214 = 3 significant digits, 81.6 = 3 significant digits, and .0086 has 2 significant digitsÂ </p><p id="mcetoc_1eisaseat8" class="align-left"><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 3</strong></span></p><p>Write out the following numbers in scientific notation. 21.8, .0068</p><p>Â 21.8 = 2.18 * 10^1 and .0068 = 6.8 8 10^-3Â </p><p>Write out the following number. \( 8.69 * 10^4 \)</p><p>\[ 8.6900 \]</p><p>Â </p><p>This section was about the basics of measurements and uncertainty. When measuring, you must always take into account the uncertainty of your tool. As you state your calculation, give the correct number of significant digits.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1h33k0pi9m" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Vectors</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quantities like mass and temperature are described with a number called a scalar. Other quantities like displacement, velocity, or force have a direction associated with them and are called vectors. When looking at a vector on paper, a vector is an arrow with the length of the arrow representing the number and direction of the vector.Â </span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A vector can be described with a number and an angle, like \( A=19 \angle 25 \deg \). When doing basic math operations, you should use the component form to write vectors. So, if a line were placed with the tail of the vector at the origin of the coordinate system, x and y portions can be calculated like this:</span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( y = 19 \sin 25^{\circ} = 8.02 \)</span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( x = 19 \cos 25^{\circ} =Â  17.21 \)</span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is how you calculate vectors.Â </span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have the x and y vectors, you can calculate the length of the corresponding line by:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( \sqrt{x^{2} + y{2}} \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( \sqrt{8.02^{2} + 17.21^{2}} \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( \sqrt{64.32 + 296.18} \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( \sqrt{360.5} = 19Â  \)</span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To find the original angle we use:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( \theta = \tan^{-1} \frac{y}{x} \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( \theta = \tan^{-1} \frac{8.02}{17.21} \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( \theta = 25^{\circ} \)</span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 1</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write out the components of the vector \( c = 47 \angle 193^{\circ} \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The x component is:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( x = 47 \cos 193^{\circ} = -45.8 \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The y component is:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( y = 47 \sin 193^{\circ} = -10.6 \)</span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of unit vectors simplifies the mathematical operations on vectors. In two dimensions, unit vectors are vectors of unit value and in the +x and +y directions.Â </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the first vector would be written as \( 18.4i + 13.8j \) and the second vector isÂ </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( -45.8i - 10.6j \).</span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can add vectors by adding the individual components. If you have:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( (18.4i + 13.8j) + (-45.8i - 10.6j) \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You just add the individual components together. The combined vector becomes:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( -27.4i + 3.2j \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subtracting vectors can also be done. It is a bit quirky, however. You will use the opposite sign of the second vector.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( (18.4i + 13.8j) - (-45.8i - 10.6j) \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This gives the result of:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( 64.2i + 24.4j \)</span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We should also know how to work backward when given the components. When we do this properly it will give us the length of the vector and its angle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us use the last vector:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( 64.2i + 24.4j \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( V = \sqrt{64.2^{2} + 24.4^{2}} = 68.7 \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( \theta = \tan^{-1}\frac{24.4}{64.2} = 20.8^{\circ} \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When put in vector form:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( V = 68.7 \angle 20.8^{\circ} \)</span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 2</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add the vectors:Â </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(A=13 \angle 50^{\circ}\)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(B=15 \angle -60^{\circ} \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(C=17 \angle 20^{\circ} \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step is to put each vector in its component form.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( A = \sin 50 * 13 = 10 = y \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( A = \cos 50 * 13 = 8.4 = x \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( A = 8.4i + 10.0j \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( B = \sin(-60) * 15 = -13 = y \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( B = \cos(-60) * 15 = 7.5 = x \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( B = 7.5i -13.0j \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( C = \sin 120 * 17 = -8.5 = y \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( C = \cos 120 * 17 = -14.7 = x \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( C = -14.7i -8.5 j \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sum all the iâ€™s and all the jâ€™s. You get:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( 1.2i -11.5j \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is your x and y dimensions</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now use the Pythagorean theorem with those values</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( \sqrt{11.5^{2} + 1.2^{2}} = 11.6 \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That gives you the length of the new vector</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, letâ€™s find the new angle</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use the inverse tangent to do this</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( \tan^{-1} \frac{-11.5}{1.2} = -84^{\circ} \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the new vector is:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\( 11.6 \angle -84^{\circ} \)</span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use as many diagrams as possible when doing problems like this. Diagrams help keep your thought processes straight and help prevent silly errors.Â </span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 3</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find the resultant of the two forces \(800(N) \angle 47^{\circ}\) and \(600(N) \angle 140^{\circ}\)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will write out all the calculation steps first, before I actually compute them</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(800 \cos 47^{\circ} = 545.6 \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(800 \sin 47^{\circ} = 585.1 \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(600 \cos 140^{\circ} = -460.0 \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(600 \sin 140^{\circ} = 385.7 \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vector 1 is: \(545.6i + 585.1j\)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vector 2 is: \(-460.0i + 385.7j\)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add the vectors together</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We get:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(85.6i + 970.8j\)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use Pythagorean theorem</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(\sqrt{85.6^{2} + 970.8^{2}}\)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The length of our new vector is:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(= 974.6 \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new angle of our vector is:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(\tan^{-1}\frac{970.8}{85.6} = 85^{\circ} \)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(974.6(N) \angle 85^{\circ}\)</span></p><p>Â </p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Scalars</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dot product of two vectors produces a scalar.

Otherwise, use the second definition.</span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1hrad2vdc6" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Kinematics</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The motion of a particle is described by giving position, velocity, and acceleration, usually as a function of time. We start with one dimension. Distance means total distance traveled, while displacement is the actual difference between endpoint and the beginning.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[Velocity = \frac{displacement}{time}\]</span></p><p>and:</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[Acceleration = \frac{v2-v1}{time}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This velocity calculation fits our present definition and is equivalent to drawing a straight line between points on the smooth curve of x versus t. Calculating velocity this way presents a problem, because, depending on the interval, we will get different answers for the velocity. To find the velocity at t=1, we found x at t=1 and x at t=2 and performed the velocity calculation. This is not a good approximation to the velocity at t=1 because the average is between t=1 and t=2. For better approximations, shorten the time interval centered about t=1. Getting it as small as you can will give better results. So, the slope of the straight line tangent to the curve at x=1 represents the velocity at x=1.</span></p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Instantaneous Velocity and Acceleration</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A more versatile definition of velocity is \(\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}\), where the interval \(\Delta t\) is very small and centered about the time where the velocity is desired. This approach leads to a general method for obtaining an expression for velocity that can be evaluated at any point rather than going through the numeric calculation whenever we want a velocity. This definition is stated as the instantaneous velocity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v = \lim\limits_{\Delta t \to \0} = \frac{dx}{dt}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This definition of the derivative is the slope of the tangent to the curve evaluated at the point in question. If we want to find the velocity of any particle traveling according to a polynomial relationship between x and t, all we need is a general technique for finding the slope of the tangent to the polynomial at any point.Â </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The instantaneous acceleration is defined as the value of \(\Delta v / \Delta t\) as \(\Delta t\) approaches zero.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[a = \lim\limits_{\Delta t \to \0} = \frac{dy}{dt}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The instantaneous acceleration is the slope of the tangent to the curve of v versus t. The general expression for the slope of any polynomial of the form \(x = ct^{n}\). The expression for the slope at any point is \(cnt^{n-1}\). Stating this in calculus terms, for any function \(x = ct^{n}\), the derivative of the function is \(cnt^{n-1}\). This can be verified in the case of the parabola by taking successively smaller intervals of \(\Delta t\) and \(\Delta x\) at any point t to verify that the slope at any point is 2t.</span></p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Kinematic Equations of Motion</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kinematic equations of motion are derived under the assumption of constant acceleration. While this may seem at first to be a restriction, there are a large number of problems where the acceleration is constant. The simplest and most obvious are falling body problems, or problems involving bodies falling on or near the surface of the earth where the acceleration due to gravity is a constant.Â </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting with the assumption of constant acceleration, we can write:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[a = \frac{v_f - v_o}{t}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This can be rearranged to this form:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[ta = v_f - v_o \longrightarrow ta + v_o = v_f \longrightarrow v_f = v_o + ta \]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We define the average velocity as:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v_{avg} = \frac{v+ v_o}{2}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We define displacement as:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[x = x_o + v_{avg}t\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can now substitute \(v_{avg}\) with the previous equation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[x = x_o + \frac{v + v_ot}{2}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One more substitution for \(v = v_o+ at\) and we get:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[x= x_o + v_ot + (Â½)at^2\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We now have the four kinematic equations of motion.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v = v_o + at\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[x - x_o = (Â½)(v + v_o)t\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[x - x_o = v_ot + (Â½) at^2\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[v^2 = v_o^2 + 2a(x - x_o)\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first three equations relate displacement, velocity, and acceleration in terms of time, while the fourth equation does not contain the time.Â </span></p><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 1</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A train starts from rest and moves with constant acceleration.

In most problems where an initial velocity and angle with the horizontal is given, the velocity is written in component form.Â <br><br>\[v_y = v_o sin \Theta\]<br>\[v_x = v_o cos \Theta\]<br><br>Note that motion is effectively separated into horizontal and vertical components. One is in the direction of constant acceleration and one is at a right angle to the acceleration.<br><br>The motion is a parabola in this coordinate system. The symmetry of parabolas is helpful in understanding the motion.<br><br>Usually, the velocity of the projectile is written in component form. The acceleration in the horizontal direction is zero and in the vertical direction is due to gravity. With the velocity components and the acceleration in the direction of an axis, we can write the six equations describing acceleration, velocity, and position in the x and y directions.<br><br>These equations are based on the kinematic equations of motion for constant acceleration:<br>\[a = \text{ constant}, v = v_o + at, \text{and} s = s_o + v_ot + (1/2)at^2\]<br><br>The six equations are:<br>\[a_x = 0\]<br>\[v_x = v_o \cos\Theta\]<br>\[x = v_o(\cos\Theta)t\]<br>\[a_y = -g\]<br>\[v_y = v_o \sin\theta - gt\]<br>\[y = v_o(\sin\Theta)t - (1/2)gt^2\]<br><br>The equations for x and y can be considered parametric equations in time. Parametric equations such as \(x = f(t)\) are equations that can be combined to produce \(y = f(x)\) or \(x = f(x)\). To find the position of the particle in x-y or y as a function of x, solve one equation for t and substitute into the other.<br><br>In this case, solve x =...for t because this is the simplest choice.<br>\[t = \frac{x}{v_o \cos\Theta}\]<br>Substitute into y=...to obtain:<br>\[y = (\tan\Theta)x - \frac{g}{2v^2_o \cos^2\Theta}x^2\]<br>This is of the form \(y=-ax^2+bx=x(-ax+b)\), which is a parabola that opens down and intercepts the y-axis (makes y=0) at x=0 and x=b/a.<br><br>The range, or value of x when y=0, can be determined from the factored form of this equation.Â <br>\[y=x{\tan\Theta-\frac{g}{2v^2_o \cos^2\Theta}x}\]<br>which tells us that y=0 at x=0 and :<br>\[x=\frac{2v^2_o}{g} \cos^2\Theta \tan\Theta= \frac{2v^2_o}{g}\]<br><br>The maximum range occurs for an angle of \(45\deg\), corresponding to \(\sin2\Theta=1\).<br>The main point is that the motion is a parabola, and the properties of parabolas can be used in solving problems in projectile motion. That the maximum range occurs at \(45\deg\) is not surprising and is generally not of interest in problems. The expression for maximum range is only of passing interest Â because the range is one of the easier things to calculate in a problem.<br><br>Do not consume precious memory space memorizing formulas for the range or time of flight. If you work problems by first writing down the six equations describing the motion, then the time of flight, range, and many other things are easily calculated.<br><br>In order to set up a problem in projectile motion, first orient one axis of a right angle coordinate system in the direction of constant acceleration. Remember to place the origin of the coordinate system and the positive direction for x and y for your convenience in solving the problems. Then write equations for acceleration, velocity, and position for each direction. Along with the symmetry for the motion, these equations can be used to find the characteristics of the projectile at any point in space or time.Â <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 1</strong></span><br>A soccer player kicks a ball at an initial velocity of 18 m/s at an angle of 36 degrees to the horizontal.

But from the reference frame of a stationary observer, there<br>must be a net center directed force on both the astronaut(gravity) and the<br>person toward the center of the circle; otherwise, the person could not be<br>moving in a circle. Is one force correct and the other incorrect? Is either of<br>these an illusion? No, they are all real forces.<br><br>Take a thoughtful trip in an airplane flying in a horizontal circle with its<br>wings vertical. The force acting on you is toward the center of the circle, but<br>you exert an equal and opposite force on the seat that is radially out of the<br>circle. In some airplanes, if the banking is done too hard, this radially<br>outward force can be so great as to the blood in the pilot to remain in the<br>lower part of the body, resulting in a loss of oxygen to the brain and what is<br>called a blackout. So the blackout is the result of a radially outward force.<br><br>Is one reference frame correct and the other incorrect? When you study<br>Einstein's theory or relativity in physics, you will come across the idea that<br>there is no one absolute reference frame. You may think that a reference frame<br>at rest relative to the ground is correct, but the Earth spins on its axis and<br>rotates around the Sun. The Sun moves around the galactic center. In relativity,<br>we always have to specify the reference frame we are considering. And the<br>observed effects of many things change depending on the chosen reference frame.Â <br><br>So, when doing circular motion problems, always think about what reference<br>frame you are considering. For the method in the preceding problem, our<br>reference frame is outside the motion, and in this perspective, we take the net<br>center directed force and set it equal to \(mv^2/r\). This is the default<br>reference frame that is commonly used to solve circular motion problems.Â </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 2, 2024</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/physics/">Physics</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fphysics-essentials.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fphysics-essentials.html&amp;via=Science%20By%20Jason&amp;text=Basics%20of%20Physics" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/linear-functions-in-algebra.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Linear Functions In Algebra</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/neutron-stars-and-black-holes.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Neutron Stars and Black Holes </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-07-26T19:36" class="feed__date">July 26, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/forces-in-physics.html" class="invert">Forces In Physics</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-07-10T18:03" class="feed__date">July 10, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/projectile-motion-in-physics.html" class="invert">Projectile Motion In Physics</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-05-13T18:47" class="feed__date">May 13, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/falling-body-problems-in-physics.html" class="invert">Falling Body Problems in Physics</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></script></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Jason Moore 2021</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
