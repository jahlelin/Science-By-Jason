Each of these functions are polynomial functions. The<br>domain of a polynomial function is the set of all real numbers. <br><br>A polynomial function is a function whose rule is given by a polynomial in one<br>variable. The degree of a polynomial function is the largest power of x that<br>appears. The zero polynomial function \(f(x)=0\) is not assigned a degree.<br>Polynomial functions are among the simplest expressions in algebra. They are<br>easy to evaluate: only addition and multiplication are required. Because of<br>this, they are often used to approximate other, more complicated functions. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 1</strong></span><br>Identifying polynomial functions<br>Determine which of the following are polynomial functions. For those that are,<br>state the degree.<br>1. \(f(x)=2-3x^4\)<br>2. \(g(x)=\sqrt{x}\)<br>3. \(h(x)=\frac{x^2-2}{x^3-1}\)<br>4. \(f(x)=0\)<br>5. \(g(x)=8\)<br>6. \(h(x)=-2x^3(x-1)^2\)<br><br>Solution:<br>1. polynomial function of degree 4<br>2. not a polynomial function because the power is 1/2 which is not an integer<br>3. not a polynomial function. it is the ratio of two polynomials and the<br>   polynomial in the denominator is of positive degree.<br>4. polynomial function of degree zero, it is not assigned a degree<br>5. nonzero constant function, which is a polynomial function of degree 0<br>6. polynomial function of degree 5<br><br>You will learn that the graph of every polynomial function is both smooth and<br>continuous. By smooth, we mean that the graph contains no sharp corners and by<br>continuous, we mean that the graph has no gaps or holes and can be drawn without<br>lifting pencil from paper.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Power Functions</strong></span><br>We begin the analysis of the graph of a polynomial function by discussing power<br>functions, a special kind of polynomial function. A power function of degree n<br>is a monomial of the form \(f(x)=ax^n\) where a is a real number, not zero, and<br>n&gt;0.<br><br>Examples of power functions include:<br>\(f(x)=3x\) is degree 1<br>\(f(x)=-5x^2\) is degree 2<br>\(f(x)=8x^3\) is degree 3<br>\(f(x)=-5x^4\) is degree 4<br><br>The graph of a power function of degree 1, \(f(x)=ax\), is a straight line, with<br>slope a, that passes through the origin. The graph of a power function of degree<br>2, \(f(x)=ax^2\), is a parabola, with vertex at the origin, that opens up if a&gt;0<br>and down if a&lt;0.<br><br>If we know how to graph a power function of the form \(f(x)=x^n\), a compression<br>or stretch, and a reflection about the x-axis will enable us to obtain the graph<br>of \(g(x)=ax^n\). Consequently, we shall concentrate on graphing power functions<br>of the form \(f(x)=x^n\).<br><br>We begin with power functions of even degree of the form \(f(x)=x^n,n\geq2\) and<br>n even. The domain of f is the set of all real numbers, and the range is the set<br>of nonnegative real numbers. Such a power function is an even function, so its<br>graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Its graph always contains the<br>origin and the points (-1,1) and (1,1).<br><br>If n=2, the graph is the familiar parabola \(y=x^2\) that opens up, with vertex<br>at the origin. If \(n\geq4\), the graph of \(f(x)=x^n\), n even, will be closer<br>to the x-axis than the parabola \(y=x^2\) if \(-1&lt;x&lt;1\) and farther from the<br>x-axis than the parabola \(y=x^2\) if \(x&lt;-1\) or if \(x&gt;1\). <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Properties of Power Functions</strong></span><br>1. f is an even function, so its graph is symmetric with respect with respect to<br>   the y-axis.<br>2. The domain is the set of all real numbers. The range is the set of<br>   nonnegative real numbers.<br>3. The graph always contains the points (-1,1) and (1,1).<br>4. As the exponent n increases in magnitude, the graph becomes more vertical<br>   when x&lt;-1 or x&gt;1. But for x near the origin, the graph tends to flatten out   and lie closer to the x-axis.<br><br>Now we consider power functions of odd degree of the form \(f(x)=x^n,n\geq3\)<br>and n odd. The domain and range of f are the set of real numbers. Such a power<br>function is an odd function, so its graph is symmetric with respect to the<br>origin. Its graph always contains the points (-1,1) and (1,1).<br><br>The graph of \(f(x)=x^n\) when n=3 has been shown several times. If \(n\geq5\),<br>the graph of \(f(x)=x^n\), n odd, will be closer to the x-axis than that of<br>\(y=x^3\) if -1&lt;x&lt;1 and farther from the x-axis than that of \(y=x^3\) if x&lt;-1<br>or if x&gt;1.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Properties of Power Functions when x is Odd</strong></span><br>1. f is an odd function, so its graph is symmetric with respect to the origin<br>2. The domain and the range are the set of all real numbers.<br>3. The graph always contains the points (-1,-1) and (1,1).<br>4. As the exponent n increases in magnitude, the graph becomes more vertical<br>   when x&lt;-1 or x&gt;1 but for x near the origin, the graph tends to flatten out<br>   and lie closer to the x-axis.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Graph Polynomial Functions using Transformation</strong></span><br>The methods of shifting, compression, stretching, and reflection will enable us<br>to graph polynomial functions that are transformations of power functions.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 2</strong></span><br>Graph \(f(x)=1-x^5\)<br><br>Solution:<br>First, start with the usual function of \(y=x^5\)<br>Multiply by -1 to reflect across the x-axis.<br>This gives us \(y=-x^5\).<br>Now, add 1 to equation which will shift the graph up 1 unit.<br>\(y=-x^5+1\) which is the same as:<br>\(y=1-x^5\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 3</strong></span><br>Graph \(f(x)=\frac{1}{2}(x-1)^4\)<br><br>Solution:<br>Take it step by step:<br>Start with the base function of \(y=x^4\)<br>Replace x by x-1 which will shift it right by 1 unit.<br>This gives us \(y=(x-1)^4\).<br>Now, multiple by 1/2 which gives the graph a compression by a factor of 1/2.<br>We now have \(y=\frac{1}{2}(x-1)^4\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Finding the Real Zeros of a Polynomial Function</strong></span><br>The previous graph and problem shows a polynomial function with four<br>x-intercepts. Notice that at the x-intercepts the graph must either cross the<br>x-axis or touch the x-axis. Consequently, between consecutive x-intercepts the<br>graph is either above the x-axis or below the x-axis. We will make use of this<br>property of the graph of a polynomial function.<br><br>If a polynomial function f is factored completely, it is easy to solve the<br>equation \(f(x)=0\) using the zero-product property and locate the x-intercepts<br>of the graph. For example, if \(f(x)=(x-1)^2(x+3)\), then the solution of the<br>equation becomes:<br>\(f(x)=(x-1)^2(x+3)=0\) which factored give us: 1 and -3 as intercepts.<br><br>Based on this we can make the following observations.<br>If f is a function and r is a real number for which f(r)-0, then r is called a<br>real zero of f.<br><br>As a consequence, the following statements are equivalent.<br>1. r is a real zero of a polynomial function f<br>2. r is an x-intercept of the graph of f<br>3. x-r is a factor of f<br><br>So, the real zeros of a polynomial function are the x-intercepts of its graph<br>and they are found by solving the equation \(f(x)=0\).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 4</strong></span><br>Finding a Polynomial from its Zeros<br>Find a polynomial of degree 3 whose zeros are -3, 2, and 5.<br><br>Solution:<br>If r is a real zero of a polynomial f, then x-r is a factor of f. This means<br>that x-(-3)=x+3, x-2, and x-5 are factors of f. As a result, any polynomial of<br>the form \(f(x)=a(x+3)(x-2)(x-5)\) where a is any nonzero real number,<br>qualifies. The value of a causes a stretch, compression, or reflection, but does<br>not affect the x-intercepts.<br><br>If the same factor x-r occurs more than once, r is called a repeated or multiple<br>zero of f. More precisely, we have the following definition.<br>If (x-r)^m is a factor of a polynomial f and (x-r)^{m+1} is not a factor of f,<br>then r is called a zero of multiplicity m of f.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 5</strong></span><br>Identifying Zeros and their Multiplicities<br>For the polynomial \(f(x)=5(x-2)(x+3)^2(x-1/2)^4\)<br><br>Solution:<br>2 is a zero of multiplicity 1 because the exponent on the factor x-2 is 1<br>-3 is a zero of multiplicity 2 because the exponent on the factor x+3 is 2<br>1/2 is a zero of multiplicity 4 because the exponent on the factor x-1/2 is 4<br><br>Suppose that it is possible to factor completely a polynomial function and<br>locate all the x-intercepts of its graph(the real zeros of the function). These<br>x-intercepts then divide the x-axis into open intervals and, on each such<br>interval, the graph of the polynomial will be either above or below the x-axis.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 6</strong></span><br>Graphing a Polynomial Using its x-intercepts<br>For the polynomial \(f(x)=x^2(x-2)\)<br>1. Find the x and y intercepts of the graph of f<br>2. Use the x-intercepts to find the intervals on which the graph of f is above<br>the x-axis and the intervals on which the graph of f is below the x-axis.<br>3. Locate other points on the graph and connect all the points plotted with a<br>smooth continuous curve.<br><br>Solution:<br>1. The y-intercept is \(f(0)=0^2(0-2)=0\). The x-intercepts satisfy the<br>equation \(f(x)=x^2(x-2)=0\) from which we find \(x^2=0\) or \(x-2=0\) and<br>\(x=0\) or \(x=2\). The x-intercepts are 0 and 2<br>2. The two x-intercepts divide the x-axis into 3 intervals.<br>\((-\infty,0)(0,2)(2,\infty)\). Since the graph of f crosses or touches the x-axis<br>only at x=0 and x=2, it follows that the graph of f is either above the x-axis<br>f(x)&gt;0 or below the x-axis f(x)&lt;0 on each of these 3 intervals. To see where the<br>graph lies, we only need to pick a number in each interval, evaluate f there,<br>and see whether the value is positive(above the x-axis) or negative(below the<br>x-axis).<br>3. in constructing a table, we obtained three additional points on the<br>graph:(-1,-3)(1,-1)(3,9).<br><br>Since the graph of \(f(x)=x^2(x-2)\) is below the x-axis on both sides of 0, the<br>graph of f touches the x-axis at x=0, a zero of multiplicity 2. Since the graph<br>of f is below the x-axis for x&lt;2 and above the graph for x&gt;2, the graph of f<br>crosses the x-axis at x=2, a multiplicity of 1.<br><br>If r is a zero of even  multiplicity the sign of f(x) does not change from one side to<br>the other side of r. The graph of f touches the x-axis at r. <br><br>If r is a zero of odd multiplicity, the sign of f(x) changes from one side to<br>the other side of r. The graph of f crosses the x-axis at r.<br><br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Behavior Near a Zero</strong></span><br>We have just learned how the multiplicity of a zero can be used to determine<br>whether the graph of a function touches or crosses the x-axis at the zero.<br>However, we can learn more about the behavior of the graph near its zeros than<br>just whether the graph crosses or touches the x-axis. <br><br>Consider the function\(f(x)=x^2(x-2)\). The zeros of f are 0 and 2. We can see<br>that the points on the graph of \(f(x)=x^2(x-2)\) and the points on the graph of<br>\(y=-2x^2\) are indistinguishable near x=0. So, \(y=-2x^2\) describes the<br>behavior of the graph of \(f(x)=x^2(x-2)\) near x=0.<br><br>But how did we know that the function \(f(x)=x^2(x-2)\) behaves like \(y=-2x^2\)<br>when x is close to 0? Where did \(y=-2x^2\) comes form? Because the zero, 0,<br>comes from the factor \(x^2\), we evaluate all factors in the function f at 0<br>with the exception of \(x^2\).<br>\(f(x)=x^2(x-2)\) <br>The factor \(x^2\) gives rise to the zero, so we keep the factor \(x^2\) and let<br>x=0 in the remaining factors to find the behavior near 0.<br>\(f(x)=x^2(0-2) = -2x^2\)<br><br>This tells us that the graph of \(f(x)=x^2(x-2)\) will behave like the graph of<br>\(y=-2x^2\) near x=0. Now let us discuss the behavior of \(f(x)=x^2(x-2)\) near<br>x=2, the other zero. Because the zero, 2, comes from the factor x-2, we<br>evaluate all factors of the function f at 2, with the exception of x-2.<br>\(f(x)=x^2(x-2) = 2^2(x-2) = 4(x-2)\)<br>The factor x-2 gives rise to the zero, so we keep the factor x-2 and let z=2 in<br>the remaining factors to find the behavior near 2.<br><br>So the graph of \(f(x)=x^2(x-2)\) will behave like the graph of \(y=4(x-2)\)<br>near x=2. We can see that the points on the graph of \(f(x)=x^2(x-2)\) and the<br>points on the graph of \(y=4(x-2)\) are indistinguishable near x=2. So<br>\(y=4(x-2)\), a line with slope 4, describes the behavior of the graph of<br>\(f(x)=x^2(x-2)\) near x=2.<br><br>By determining the multiplicity of a real zero, we determine that the graph<br>crosses or touches the x-axis at the zero. By determining the behavior of the<br>graph near the real zero, we determine how the graph touches or crosses the<br>x-axis.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Turning Points</strong></span><br>When looking at the previous graph, we cannot be sure how low the graph actually<br>goes between x=0 and x=2. but we do know that somewhere in the interval (0,2)<br>the graph of f must change direction (from decreasing to increasing). The points<br>at which a graph changes direction are called turning points. In calculus, such<br>points are called local maxima and local minima, and techniques for locating<br>them are given. So we shall not ask for the location of turning points in our<br>graphs. Instead, we will use the following result from calculus, which tells us<br>the maximum number of turning points that the graph of a polynomial function can<br>have.<br><br>If f is a polynomial function of degree n, then f has at most n-1 turning<br>points.<br>If the graph of a polynomial function f has n-1 turning points, the degree of f<br>is at least n.<br><br>For example, the graph of \(f(x)=x^2(x-2)\) is the graph of a polynomial of degree<br>3 and 3-1=2 turning points: one at (0,0) and the other somewhere between x=0 and<br>x=2.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 7</strong></span><br>Identifying the graph of a polynomial function<br>Which of the graphs could be the graph of a polynomial function? For those that<br>could, list the real zeros and state the least degree the polynomial can have.<br>For those that could not, say why not.<br><br>Solution:<br>1. This cannot be the graph of a polynomial function because of the gap that<br>occurs at x=-1. Remember, the graph of a polynomial function is continuous with<br>no gaps or holes.<br>2. This could be the graph of a polynomial function. It has 3 real zeros at -2,<br>1, and 2. Since the graph has 2 turning points, the degree of the polynomial<br>function must be at least 3.<br>3. This cannot be the graph of a polynomial function because of the cusp at x=1.<br>Remember, the graph of a polynomial function is smooth.<br>4. This could be the graph of a polynomial function. It has 2 real zeros at -2<br>and 1. Since the graph has 3 turning points, the degree of the polynomial<br>function is at least 4.<br><br>For very large values of x, either positive or negative, the graph of<br>\(f(x)=x^2(x-2)\) looks like the graph of \(y-=x^3\). To see why, we write f in<br>the form:<br>\(f(x)=x^2(x-2)=x^3-2x^2=x^3(1-\frac{2}{x})\)<br>Now, for large values of x, either positive or negative, the term 2/x is close to<br>0, so for large values of x:<br>\(f(x)=x^3-2x^2=x^3(1-\frac{2}{x})=x^3\)<br>The behavior of the graph of a function for large values of x, either positive<br>or negative, is referred to as its end behavior.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 8</strong></span><br>Identifying the graph of a polynomial function<br>Which of the graphs could be the graph of:<br>\(f(x)=x^4+5x^3+5x^2-5x-6\)<br><br>Solution:<br>The y-intercept of f is f(0)=-6 so we can eliminate any graph whose y-intercept<br>is positive. Being positive means the curve crosses the y-axis above 0.<br>We don't have any methods for finding the x-intercept of f, so we move on to<br>investigate the turning points of each graph. since f is of degree 4, the graph<br>of f has at most 3 turning points. So, we eliminate the graph that has 5 turning<br>points. <br>Now, we look at end behavior. For large values of x, the graph of f will behave<br>like the graph of \(y=x^4\). This eliminates the graph whose end behavior is<br>like the graph of \(y=-x^4\). <br>Only the graph left is the graph which has 3 turning points and behaves like<br>\(x^4\).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Summary of Polynomial Functions</strong></span><br>Degree of polynomial f: n<br>Maximum number of turning points: n-1<br>At a zero of even multiplicity: the graph of f touches the x axis<br>At a zero of odd multiplicity: the graph of f crosses the x-axis.<br>Between zeros, the graph of f is either above or below the x-axis<br>End behavior: For large |x|, the graph of f behaves like the graph of of<br>\(y=a_{n}x^{n}\).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 9</strong></span><br>Analyzing the Graph of a Polynomial Function<br>For the polynomial \(f(x)=x^3+x^2-12x\) :<br>1.
