One method we<br>can employ is to adapt the basic graphs of the toolkit functions to build new<br>models for a given scenario. There are systematic ways to alter functions to<br>construct appropriate models for the problems we are trying to solve.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Identifying Vertical Shifts</strong></span><br>One simple kind of transformation involves shifting the entire graph of a<br>function up, down, right, or left. The simplest shift is a vertical shift,<br>moving the graph up or down, because this transformation involves<br>adding a positive or negative constant to the function. In other words,<br>we add the same constant to the output value of the function regardless of<br>the input. For a function \(g(x)=f(x)+k\), the function f(x) is shifted<br>vertically k units. To help visualize the concept of a vertical shift, consider<br>that \(y=f(x)\). Therefore, \(f(x)+k\) is equivalent to \(y+k\). Every unit of<br>y is replaced by \(y+k\), so the y-value increases or decreases depending on<br>the value of k. The result is a shift upward or downward.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Vertical Shift</strong></span><br>Given a function, f(x), a new function g(x)=f(x)+k where k is a constant, is<br>a vertical shift of the function f(x). All the output values change by k units.<br>If k is positive, the graph will shift up. If k is negative, the graph will<br>shift down. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 1</strong></span><br>Adding a Constant to a Function<br>To regulate temperature in a green building, airflow vents near the roof open<br>and close throughout the day. During the summer, the facilities manager<br>decides to try to better regulate temperature by increasing the amount of<br>open vents by 20 square feet throughout the day and night. Sketch a graph of<br>this new function. <br><br>Solution:<br>We can sketch a graph of this new function by adding 20 to each of the output<br>values of the original function. This will have the effect of shifting the<br>graph vertically up. Notice that for each input value, the output value has<br>increased by 20, so if we call the new function S(t), we could write<br>\(S(t)=V(t)+20\).<br><br>This notation tells us that, for any value of t, S(t) can be found by<br>evaluating the function V at the same input and then adding 20 to the result.<br>This defines S as a transformation of the function V, in this case a vertical<br>shift up 20 units. Notice that, with a vertical shift, the input values stay the<br>same and only the output values change.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Given a tabular function, create a new row to represent a vertical</strong></span><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>shift.</strong></span><br>1. Identify the output row or column<br>2. Determine the magnitude of the shift<br>3. Add the shift to the value in each output cell. Add a positive value for up<br>or a negative value for down.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 2</strong></span><br>Shifting a Tabular Function Vertically<br><br>Solution:<br>The formula g(x)=f(x)-3 tells us that we can find the output values of g by<br>subtracting 3 from the output values of f.<br>\(f(2)=1\)<br>\(g(x)=f(x)-3\)<br>\(g(2)=f(2)-3\)<br>\(1-3=-2\)<br><br>As with the earlier vertical shift, notice the input values stay the same and<br>only the output values change.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Identifying Horizontal Shifts</strong></span><br>We just saw that the vertical shift is a change to the output, or outside of the<br>function. We will now look at how changes to input, on the inside of the<br>function, change its graph and meaning. A shift to the input results in a<br>movement of the graph of the function left or right in what is known as a<br>horizontal shift.<br><br>For example, if \(f(x)=x^2\). then \(g(x)=(x-2)^2\) is a new function. Each<br>input is reduced by 2 prior to squaring the function. The result is that the<br>graph is shifted 2 units to the right, because we would need to increase<br>the prior input by 2 units to yield the same output value as given in f.<br><br>Horizontal Shift<br>Given a function, f, a new function g(x)=f(x-h), where h is a constant, is a<br>horizontal shift of the function f. If h is positive the graph will shift to<br>the right. If h is negative then the graph will shift to the left. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 3</strong></span><br>Adding a Constant to an Input<br>Returning to our building airflow example, suppose that in autumn the<br>facilities manager decides that the original venting plan starts too late, and<br>wants to begin the entire venting program 2 hours earlier. Sketch a graph<br>of the new function.<br><br>Solution:<br>We can set V(t) to be the original program and F(t) to be the revised program.<br>V(t)= the original venting plan<br>F(t)= starting 2 hours sooner<br><br>in the new graph, at each time, the airflow is the same as the original<br>function V, was 2 hours later. For example, in the original function V, the<br>airflow starts to change at 8 am, whereas for the function F, the airflow<br>starts to change at 6 am. The comparable function values are V(8)=F=(6).<br>Notice also that the vents first opened top \(220 ft^2\) at 10 am under the<br>original plan, while under the new plan the vents reach \(220 ft^2\) at<br>8am, so V(10)=F(8). In both cases, we see that,. because F(t) starts 2<br>hours sooner, h=-2. That means that the same output values are reached when:<br>\(F(t)=V(t)-(-2)) = V(t+2)\)<br><br>Note that V(t+2) has the effect of shifting the graph to the left. Horizontal<br>changes affect the domain of a function instead of the range and often seem<br>counterintuitive. The new function F(t) uses the same outputs as V(t), but<br>matches those outputs to inputs 2 hours earlier than those of V(t). Said<br>another way, we must add 2 hours to the input of V to find the corresponding<br>output of F: F(t)=V(t+2).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Given a tabular function, create a new row to represent a horizontal</strong></span><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>shift.</strong></span><br>1. Identify the input row or column<br>2. Determine the magnitude of the shift<br>3. Add the shift to the value in each input cell.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 4</strong></span><br>Shifting a Tabular Function Horizontally<br>A function f(x) is given, create a table for the function g(x)=f(x-3).<br><br>Solution:<br>The formula \(g(x)=f(x-3)\) tells us that the output values of g are the same<br>as the output value of f when the input value is 3 less than the original<br>value. for example, we know that f(2)=1. To get the same output from the<br>function g, we will need an input value that is 3 larger. We input a value<br>that is 3 larger for g(x) because the function takes 3 away before evaluating<br>the function f.<br>\(g(5)=f(5-3)=f(2)=1\)<br><br>The result is that the function g(x) has been shifted to the right by 3. Notice<br>the output values for g(x) remain the same as the output values for f(x),<br>but the corresponding values, x, have shifted to the right by 3. Specifically,<br>2 shifted to 5,4 shifted to 7, 6 shifted to 9, and 8 shifted to 11.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 5</strong></span><br>Identifying a Horizontal Shift of a Toolkit function<br>The graph represents a transformation of the toolkit function \(f(x)=x^2\).<br>Relate this new function g(x) to f(x), and then find a formula for g(x).<br><br>Solution:<br>Notice that the graph is identical in shape to the \(f(x)=x^2\) function,<br>but the x-values are shifted to the right 2 units. The vertex used to be at<br>(0,0), but now the vertex is at (2,0). The graph is the basic quadratic<br>function shifted 2 units to the right.<br>\(g(x)=f(x-2)\)<br><br>Notice how we must input the value x=2 to get the output value y=0. The<br>x-values must be 2 units larger because of the shift to the right by 2 units.<br>We can then use the definition of the f(x) function to write a formula for g(x)<br>by evaluating f(x-2).<br>\(F(x)=x^2\)<br>\(g(x)=f(x-2)\)<br>\(g(x)=f(x)-20=(x-2)^2\)<br><br>To determine whether the shift is +2 or -2, consider a single reference point on<br>the graph. For a quadratic, looking at the vertex point is convenient. In<br>the original function, f(0)=0. In out shifted function, g(2)=0. To<br>obtain the output value 0 from the function f, we need to decide whether a plus<br>or minus sign will work to satisfy g(2)=f(x-2)=f(0)=0. For this to work, we will<br>need to subtract 2 units form out input values.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 6</strong></span><br>Interpreting Horizontal versus Vertical Shifts<br>The function G(m) gives the number of gallons of gas required to drive m<br>miles. Interpret G(m)+10 and G(m+10).<br><br>Solution:<br>G(m)+10 can be interpreted as adding 10 to the output, gallons. This is the gas<br>required to drive m miles, plus another 10 gallons of gas. The graph would<br>indicate a vertical shift.<br><br>G(m+10) can be interpreted as adding 10 to the input, miles. So this is the<br>number of gallons of gas required to drive 10 miles more than m miles. The<br>graph would indicate a horizontal shift.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Combining Vertical and Horizontal Shifts</strong></span><br>Now that we have two transformations, we can combine them together. Vertical<br>shifts are outside changes that affect the input x axis values and shift<br>the function left or right. Combining the two types of shifts will cause the<br>graph of a function to shift up or down and right or left.<br><br>Given a function and both a vertical and a horizontal shift, sketch the graph.<br>1. Identify the vertical and horizontal shifts from the formula.<br>2. The vertical shift results from a constant added to the output. Move the<br>graph up for a positive constant and down for a negative constant.<br>3. The horizontal shift results from a constant added to the input. Move the<br>graph left for a positive constant and right for a negative constant. <br>4. Apply the shifts to the graph in either order.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 7</strong></span><br>Graphing Combined Vertical and Horizontal Shifts<br>Given f(x)=|x|, sketch a graph of h(x)=f(x+1)-3<br><br>Solution:<br>The function f is our toolkit absolute value function. We know that this graph<br>has a v shape, with the point at the origin. The graph of h has transformed f in<br>two ways: f(x+1) is a change on the inside of the function, giving a<br>horizontal shift left by 1, and the subtraction by 3 in f(x+1)-3 is a change<br>to the outside of the function, giving a vertical shift down by 3.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 8</strong></span><br>Identifying Combined Vertical and Horizontal Shifts<br>Write a formula for the graph shown, which is a transformation of the<br>toolkit square root function.<br><br>Solution:<br>The graph of the toolkit function starts at the origin, so this graph has<br>been shifted 1 to the right and up 2. In function notation, we could write<br>that as \(h(x)=f(x-2)+2\). Using the formula for the square root function, we<br>can write \(h(x)=\sqrt{x-1}+2\).<br><br>Note that this transformation has changed the domain and range of the<br>function. This new graph has domain \([1,\infty)\) and range \([2,\infty)\).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Graphing Functions Using Reflections about the Axes</strong></span><br>Notice that the vertical reflection produces a new graph that is a mirror<br>image of the base or original graph about the y-axis. The horizontal reflection<br>produces a new graph that is a mirror image of the base or original graph<br>about the y-axis.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Reflections</strong></span><br>Given a function f(x), a new function g(x)=-f(x) is a vertical reflection of<br>the function f(x), sometimes called a reflection about the x-axis.<br>Given a function f(x), a new function g(x)=f(-x) is a horizontal reflection of<br>the function f(x), sometimes called a reflection about the y-axis.<br><br>Given a function, reflect the graph both vertically and horizontally<br>1. Multiply all outputs by -1 for a vertical reflection. The new graph<br>is a reflection of the original graph about the x-axis.<br>2. Multiply all outputs by -1 for a horizontal reflection. The new graph<br>is a reflection of the original graph about the y-axis.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 9</strong></span><br>Reflecting a Graph Horizontally and Vertically<br>Reflect the graph of \(s(t)=\sqrt{t}\) vertically and horizontally.<br><br>Solution:<br>Reflecting the graph vertically means that each output value will be reflected<br>over the horizontal t-axis.<br>Because each output value is the opposite of the original output value, we<br>can write: \(V(t)=-s(t)\).<br>Notice that his is an outside change, or vertical shift, that affects the<br>output s(t) values, so the negative sign belongs outside of the function.<br>Reflecting horizontally means that each input value will be reflected over<br>the vertical axis.<br>Because each input value is the opposite of the original input value, we<br>can write: \(H(t)=s(-t)\).<br>Notice that this is an inside change or horizontal change that affects the<br>input values, so the negative sign is on the inside of the function.<br><br>Note that these transformation can affect the domain and range of the<br>functions. While the original square root function has domain \([0,\infty)\) and<br>range \([0,\infty), the vertical reflection gives the V(t) function the range<br>\((-\infty.0])\) and the horizontal reflection gives the H(t) function the<br>domain \((-\infty,0])\).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 10</strong></span><br>Reflecting a Tabular Function Horizontally and Vertically<br>A function f(x) is given, create a table for the functions:<br>g(x)=-f(x)<br>h(x)=f(-x)<br>x   2   4   6   8<br>f(x)1   3   7   11<br><br>Solution:<br>For g(x), the negative sign outside the function indicates a vertical<br>reflection, so the x-values stay the same and each output value will be the<br>opposite of the original output value.<br><br>For h(x), the negative sign inside the function indicates a horizontal<br>reflection, so each input value will be the original input value and the h(x)<br>values stay the same as the f(x) values.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 11</strong></span><br>Applying a Learning Model Equation<br>A common model for learning has an equation similar to \(k(t)=2^{-2} + 1\),<br>where k is the percentage of mastery that can be achieved after t<br>practice sessions. This is a transformation of the function \(f(t)=2^t\).<br><br>Solution:<br>This equation combines three transformations into one equation.<br>1. A horizontal reflection:\(f(-t)=2^{-t}\)<br>2. A vertical reflection:\(-f(-t)=-2^{-t}\)<br>3. A vertical shift:\(-f(-t)=-2^{-t} + 1\)<br><br>We can sketch a graph by applying these transformations one at a<br>time to the original function. Let us follow two points through each of<br>the three transformations. We will choose the points (0,1) and (1,2).<br>1. First, we apply a horizontal reflection: (0,1)(-1,2)<br>2. Then, we apply a vertical reflection:(0,-1)(-1,-2)<br>3. Finally, we apply a vertical shift:(0,0)(-1,-1)<br><br>This means that the original points, (0,1) and (1,2) become (0,0) and (-1,-1)<br>after we apply the transformations.<br><br>As a model for learning, this function would be limited to a domain of<br>\(t \geq 0\), with a corresponding range of [0,1).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Determining Even and Odd Functions</strong></span><br>Some functions exhibit symmetry so that reflections result in the original<br>graph. For example, horizontally reflecting the toolkit functions<br>\(f(x)=x^2\) or \(f(x)=|x|\) will result in the original graph. We say<br>these types of graphs are symmetric about the y-axis. Functions whose graphs<br>are symmetric about the y-axis are called even functions. In the graphs<br>of \(f(x)=x^3\) or \(f(x)=1/x\) were reflected over both axes, the result<br>would be the original graph.<br><br>We say that these graphs are symmetric about the origin. A function with a<br>graph that is symmetric about the origin is called an odd function. A function<br>can be neither even nor odd if it does not exhibit symmetry. For example,<br>\(f(x)=2^x\) is neither even nor odd. Also, the only function that is both<br>even and odd is the constant function \(f(x)=0\).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Even and Odd Functions</strong></span><br>A function is called an even function if for every input of x:<br>\(f(x)=f(-x)\).<br>The graph of an even function is symmetric about the y-axis.<br>A function is called an odd function if for every input of x:<br>\(f(x)=-f(-x)\).<br>The graph of an odd function is symmetric about the origin.<br><br>Given the formula for a function, determine if the function is even, odd, or<br>neither.<br>1. Determine whether the function satisfies \(f(x)=f(-x)\). If it does, it is<br>even.<br>2. Determine whether the function satisfies \(f(x)=-f(-x)\). If it does, it<br>is odd. <br>3. If the function does not satisfy either rule, it is neither even nor odd.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 12</strong></span><br>Determining whether a Function is Even, odd, or neither<br>Is the function \(f(x)=x^3+2x\) even, odd, or neither?<br><br>Solution:<br>Without looking at a graph, we can determine whether the function is even or<br>odd by finding formulas for the reflections and determining if they<br>return us to the original function. Let us begin with the rule for even<br>functions.<br>\(f(-x)=(-x)^3 + 2(-x) = -x^3 - 2x\)<br>This does not return us to the original function, so this function is not<br>even. We can now test the rule for odd functions.<br>\(-f(-x)=-(-x^3-2x)=x^3+2x\)<br>Because \(-f(-x)=f(x)\), this is an odd function.<br><br>Consider the graph of f. Notice that the graph is symmetric about the<br>origin. For every point (x,y) on the graph, the corresponding<br>point(-x,-y) is also on the graph. For example, (1,3) is on the graph of f, and<br>the corresponding point (-1,-3) is also on the graph.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Graphing Functions Using Stretches and Compressions</strong></span><br>Adding a constant to the inputs of a function changed the position of a graph<br>with respect to the axes, but it did not affect the shape of a graph. We now<br>explore the effects of multiplying the inputs or outputs by some quantity.<br>We can transform the inside (input values) of a function or we can<br>transform the outside (output values) of a function. Each change has a<br>specific effect that can be seen graphically.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Vertical Stretches and Compressions</strong></span><br>When we multiply a function by a positive constant, we get a function whose<br>graph is stretched or compressed vertically in relation to the graph of<br>the original function. If the constant is greater than 1, we get a vertical<br>stretch. If the constant is between 0 and 1, we get a vertical compression. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Vertical Stretches and Compressions</strong></span><br>Given a function f(x), a new function g(x)=af(x), where a is a constant, is<br>a vertical stretch or vertical compression of the function f(x).<br>1. If a&gt;1 then the graph will be stretched.<br>2. If 0&lt;a&lt;1, then the graph will be compressed.<br>3. If a&lt;0, then there will be a combination of a vertical stretch with a<br>vertical reflection.<br><br>Given a function, graph its vertical stretch<br>1. Identify the value of a<br>2.

When we multiply a<br>function's input by a positive constant, we get a function whose graph is<br>stretched or compressed horizontally in relation to the graph of the original<br>function.

Notice that we<br>do not have enough information to determine g(2) because g(2)-f(1/2(2))=f(1),<br>and we do not have a value for f(1) in our table. Our input values to g will<br>need to be twice as large to get inputs for f that we can evaluate. For example,<br>we can determine g(4).<br>\(g(4)=f(1/2(4))=f(2)=1\)<br><br>Because each input value has been doubled, the result is that the function g(x)<br>has been stretched horizontally by a factor of 2.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 18</strong></span><br>Recognizing a Horizontal Compression on a Graph<br>Relate the function g(x) to f(x).<br><br>Solution:<br>The graph of g(x) looks like the graph of f(x) horizontally compressed. Because<br>f(x) ends at (6,4) and g(x) ends at (2,4), we can see that the x-values have<br>been compressed to 1/3, because 6(1/3)=2. We might also notice that g(2)=f(6)<br>and g(1)=f(3). Either way, we can describe this relationship as g(x)=f(3x). This<br>is a horizontal compression by 1/3.<br><br>Notice that the coefficient needed for a horizontal stretch or compression is<br>the reciprocal of the stretch or compression. So, to stretch the graph<br>horizontally by a scale factor of 4, we need a coefficient of 1/4 in our<br>function: f(1/4(x)). This means that the input values must be 4 times larger to<br>produce the same result, requiring the input to be larger, causing the<br>horizontal stretching.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Performing a Sequence of Transformations</strong></span><br>When combining transformations, it is very important to consider the order of<br>the transformations. For example, vertically shifting by 3 and then vertically<br>stretching by 2 does not create the same graph as vertically stretching by 2 and<br>then vertically shifting by 3, because when we shift first, both the original<br>function and the shift get stretched, while only the original function gets<br>stretched when we stretch first.<br><br>When we see an expression such as 2f(x)+3, which transformation should we start<br>with? The answer here follows nicely from the order of operations. Given the<br>output value of f(x), we first multiply by 2, causing the vertical stretch, and<br>then add 3, causing the vertical shift. In other words, multiplication before<br>addition.<br><br>Horizontal transformations are a little trickier to think about. When we write<br>g(x)=f(2x+3), for example, we have to think about how the inputs to the function<br>g relate to the inputs to the function f. Suppose we know f(7)=12. What input to<br>g would produce that output? In other words, what value of x will allow<br>g(x)=f(2x+3)=12? We would need 2x+3=7. To solve for x, we would first subtract<br>3, resulting in a horizontal shift, and then divide by 2, causing a horizontal<br>compression. <br><br>This format ends up being very difficult to work with, because it is usually<br>much easier to horizontally stretch a graph before shifting. We can work around<br>this by factoring inside the function.<br>\(f(bx+p)=f(b(x+\frac{p}{b}))\)<br>So:<br>\(f(x)=(2x+4)^2\)<br>We can factor out a 2<br>\(f(x)=(2(x+2))^2\)<br>Now we can more clearly observe a horizontal shift to the left 2 units and a<br>horizontal compression. Factoring in this way allows us to horizontally stretch<br>first and then shift horizontally.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Combining Transformations</strong></span><br>When combining vertical transformations written in the form af(x)+k, first<br>vertically stretch by a and then vertically shift by k.<br><br>When combining horizontal transformations written in the form f(bx-h), first<br>horizontally shift by h/b and then horizontally stretch by 1/b.<br><br>When combining horizontal transformations written in the form f(b(x-h)), first<br>horizontally stretch by 1/b and then horizontally shift by h.<br><br>Horizontal and vertical transformation are independent.
