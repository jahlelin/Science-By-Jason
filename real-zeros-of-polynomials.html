Recall that if r is a real zero of a polynomial<br>function f then f(r)=0, r is an x-intercept of the graph of f, and r is a<br>solution of the equation f(x)=0.<br><br>For polynomial and rational functions, we have seen the importance of the real<br>zeros for graphing. In most cases, the real zeros of a polynomial function are<br>difficult to find using algebraic methods. No nice formulas like the quadratic<br>formula are available to help us find zeros for polynomials of degree 3 or<br>higher. Formulas do exist for solving any third or fourth degree polynomial<br>equation, but they are complicated to use. No general formulas exist for<br>polynomial equations of degree 5 or higher.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Remainder and Factor Theorems</strong></span><br>When we divide one polynomial by another, we obtain a quotient polynomial and a<br>remainder, the remainder being either the zero polynomial or a polynomial whose<br>degree is less than the degree of the divisor. To check our work, we do:<br>(quotient)(divisor) + remainder = dividend<br>This checking routine is the basis for a famous theorem called the division<br>algorithm for polynomials.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Remainder Theorem</strong></span><br>Let f be a polynomial function. If f(x) is divided by x-c, then the remainder is<br>f(c).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 1</strong></span><br>Using the remainder theorem<br>Find the remainder if \(f(x)=x^3-4x^2-5\) when divided by x-3 and x+2<br><br>Solution:<br>We could use long division, but who wants to do that, it is easier to use the<br>remainder theorem.<br>\(f(3)=(3)^3-4(3)^2-5 = 27-36-5 = 14\)<br>The remainder is 14<br><br>To find the remainder when f(x) is divided by x+2 = x-(-2) = -2<br>\(f(-2) = (-2)^3-4(-2)^2-5 = -8-16-5 = -29\)<br>The remainder is -29<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Factor Theorem</strong></span><br>Let f be a polynomial function. Then x-c is a factor of f(x) if ands only if<br>f(c)=0. If f(c)=0, then x-c is a factor of f(x). If x-c is a factor of f(x),<br>then f(c)=0.<br><br>Suppose that f(c)=0. Then, we have \(f(x)=(x-c)q(x)\) for some polynomial q(x).<br>That is, x-c is a factor of f(x). Suppose that x-c is a factopr of f(x). Then<br>there is a polynomial function q such that \(f(x)=(x-c)q)x)\). Replacing x by c,<br>we find that \(f(c)=(c-c)q(c) = 0*q(c) = 0\). That completes the proof. One use<br>of the factor theorem is to determine whether a polynomial has a particular<br>factor.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 2</strong></span><br>Use the factor theorem to determine whether a function has a factor<br>\(f(x)=2x^3-x^2+2x-3\)<br>For x-1 and x+3<br><br>Solution:<br>That factor theorem states that if f(c)=0 then x-c is a factor<br>Because x-1 is of the form x-c with c=1, we find the value of f(1). We choose to<br>use substitution.<br>\(f(1) = 2(1)^3-(1)^2+2(1)-3 = 2-1+2-3 = 0\)<br>By the factor theorem, x-1 is a factor of x.<br><br>To test the factor x+3, we first need to write it in the form of x-c. Since<br>x+3=x-(-3), we find the value of f(-3). Because f(-3) =-72 and not 0, we<br>conclude from the factor theorem that x-(-3) or x+3 is not a factor of f(x).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Number of Real Zeros</strong></span><br>The next theorem concerns the number of real zeros that a polynomial function<br>may have. In counting the zeros of a polynomial, we count each zero as many<br>times as its multiplicity.<br>A polynomial function cannot have more real zeros than its degree.<br><br>The proof is based on the factor theorem. If r is a real zero of a polynomial<br>function f, then f(r)=0 and so, x-r is a factor of f(x). Each real zero<br>corresponds to a factor of degree 1. Because f cannot have more first degree<br>factors than its degree.<br><br>Descarte's rule of signs provides information about the number and location of<br>the real zeros of a polynomial function written in standard form. It requires<br>that we count the number of variations in the sign of the coefficients of f(x)<br>and f(-x). For example, the following polynomial function has two variations in<br>the signs of the coefficients.<br>\(f(x)=3x^7+4x^4+3x^2-2x-1 = -3x^7+0x^6+0x^5+4x^4+0x^3+3x^2-2x-1\)<br>Notice that we ignored the zero coefficients in \(0x^6,0x^5\) and \(0x^3\) in<br>counting the number of variations in the sign of f(x). Replacing x by -x, we<br>get:<br>\(f(-x)=-3(-x)^7+4(-x)^4+3(-x)^2-2(-x)-1 = 3x^7+4x^4+3x^2+2x-1\)<br>This has one variation in sign.<br><br>Descarte's Rule of Signs<br>Let f denote a polynomial function written in standard form. <br>The number of positive real zeros of f either equals the number of variations in<br>the sign of the nonzero coefficients of f(x) or else equals that number  less an<br>even integer.<br>The number of negative real zeros of f either equals the number of variations in<br>the sign of the nonzero coefficients of f(-x) or else equals that number less an<br>even integer.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 3</strong></span><br>Using the number of real zeros theorem and the rule of signs.<br>Discuss the real zeros of \(f(x)=3x^6-4x^4+3x^3+2x^2-x-3\)<br><br>Solution:<br>Because the polynomial is of degree 6, by the real zeros theorem there are at<br>most six real zeros. Since there are three variations in the sign of the nonzero<br>coefficients of f(x), by the rule of signs, we expect either three or one<br>positive real zero. To continue, look at f(-x).<br>\(f(-x)=3x^6-4x^4-3x^3+2x^2+x-3\)<br>There are three variations in sign, so we expect either three or one negative<br>real zeros. Equivalently, we know now that the graph of f has either three or one<br>positive x-intercepts and three or one negative x-intercepts.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Rational Zeros Theorem</strong></span><br>The rational zeros theorem provides information about the rational zeros of a<br>polynomial with integer coefficients.<br>Let f be a polynomial function of degree 1 or higher of the form:<br>\(f(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...a_{1}x+a_{0}\)<br>Each coefficient is an integer. If p/q is in lowest terms, it is a rational zero<br>of f, then p must be a factor of \(a_o\), and q must be a factor of \(a_n\).<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 4</strong></span><br>Listing potential rational zeros<br>\(f(x)=2x^3+11x^2-7x-6\)<br><br>Solution:<br>Because f has integer coefficients, we may use the rational zero theorem. First,<br>we list all the integers p that are factors of the constant term a0=-6 and all<br>the integers q that are factors of the leading coefficient ay=2.<br>\(p:....\pm1,\pm2,\pm3,\pm6\)<br>\(q:....\pm1,\pm2\)<br>Now, we form all possible ratios p/q<br>\(\frac{p}{q}:....\pm1,\pm2,\pm3,\pm6,\pm\frac{1}{2},\pm\frac{3}{2}\)<br>If f has a rational zero, it will be found in this list, which contains 12<br>possibilities.<br><br>Be sure that you understand what the rational zeros theorem says. For a<br>polynomial with integer coefficients, if there is a rational zero, it is one of<br>those listed. It may be the case that the function does not have any rational<br>zeros.<br><br>Long division, synthetic division, or substitution can be used to test each<br>potential rational zero to determine whether it is indeed a zero. To make the<br>work easier, integers are usually tested first.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 5</strong></span><br>Finding the rational zeros of a polynomial function<br>\(f(x)=2x^3+11x^2-7x-6\)<br>Write f in factored form<br><br>Solution:<br>We gather all the information that we can about the zeros.<br>1. There are at most 3 zeros<br>2. By the rule of signs, there is one positive real zero. Also, because<br>\(f(-x)=-2x^3+11x^2+7x-6\)<br>There are two negative zeros or no negative zeros.<br>3. Now we use the list of potential rational zeros obtained in the previous<br>example.<br>\(\pm1,\pm2,\pm3,\pm6,\pm\frac{1}{2},\pm\frac{3}{2}\)<br>We choose to test the potential rational zero using substitution.<br>\(f(1)=2(1)^3+11(1)^2-7(1)-6 = 2+11-7-6 = 0\)<br>Since f(1)=0, 1 is a zero and x-1 is a factor of f. We can use long division or<br>synthetic division to factor f.<br>\(f(x)=2x^3+11x^2-7x-6 = (x-1)(2x^2+13x+6)\)<br><br>Now, any solution of the equation \(2x^2+13x+6=0\) will be a zero of f. Because<br>of this, we call the equation a depressed equation of f. Since the degree of the<br>depressed equation of f is less than that of the original polynomial, it is<br>easier to work with the depressed equation to find the zeros of f.<br>4. The depressed equation \(2x^2+13x+6=0\) is a quadratic equation with<br>discriminant \(b^2-4ac = 169-48 = 121 &gt; 0\). The equation has two real<br>solutions, which can be found by factoring:<br>\(2x^2+13x+6 = (2x+1)(x+6) = 0\)<br>\(2x+1 = 0\) and \(x+6 = 0\)<br>So, \(x=-\frac{1}{2}\) or \(x = -6\)<br>The zeros of f are \(-6,-\frac{1}{2},1\)<br>We know that \(f(x)=2x^3+11x^2-7x-6\) can be written as<br>\(f(x)=(x-1)(2x^2+13x+6)\). Because \(2x^2+13x+6 = (2x+1)(x+6)\), we write f in<br>factored form as: \(f(x)=(x-1)(2x+1)(x+6)\)<br>Notice that the three zeros of f are found in this example are among those given<br>in the list of potential zeros. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Find the Real Zeros of a Polynomial Function</strong></span><br>1. Use the degree of the polynomial to determine the maximum number of real<br>zeros.<br>2. Use the rule of signs to determine the possible number of positive zeros and<br>negative zeros.<br>3. If the polynomial has integer coefficients, use the rational zeros theorem to<br>identify those rational numbers that potentially could be zeros.<br>Use substitution, synthetic division, or long division to test each potential<br>rational zero. Each time that a zero(and thus a factor) is found, repeat step 3<br>on the depressed equation.<br>4. In attempting to find the zeros, remember to use the factoring techniques<br>that you already know.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 6</strong></span><br>Finding the real zeros of a polynomial function<br>Find the real zeros of \(f(x)=x^5-5x^4+12x^3-24x^2+32x-16\)<br>Write f in factored form.<br><br>Solution:<br>We gather all the information that we can about the zeros.<br>There are at most 5 real zeros because of \(x^5\).<br>By the rule of signs, there are 5, three, or one positive zero.<br>There are no negative zeros because \(f(x)=-x^5-5x^4-12x^3-24x^2-32x-16\) has no<br>variation in sign.<br>Because the leading coefficient \(a_{5}=1\) and there are no negative zeros, the<br>potential rational zeros are the integers 1,2,4,8, and 16, the positive factors<br>of the constant term, 16.
