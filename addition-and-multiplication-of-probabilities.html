The word “or” in the addition rule is associated with the addition of probabilities.</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Multiplication Rule</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This section also presents the basic multiplication rule used for finding P(A and B), which is the probability that event A occurs and event B occurs. The word “and” in the multiplication rule is associated with the multiplication of probabilities.</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Compound Event</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A compound event is any event combining two or more simple events.</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Addition Rule</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is the notation for the addition rule. P(A or B) = P(in a single trial, event A occurs or event B occurs or they both occur).</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Intuitive Addition Rule</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To find P(A or B), add the number of ways event A can occur and the number of ways event B can occur, but add in such a way that every outcome is counted only once. P(A or B) is equal to that sum, divided by the total number of outcomes in the sample space.</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Formal Addition Rule</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where P(A and B) denotes the probability that A and B both occur at the same time as an outcome in a trial of a procedure.</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Disjoint Events and the Addition Rule</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Events A and B are disjoint or mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time. That is, disjoint events do not overlap.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Event A - Randomly selecting someone for a clinical trial who is a male.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Event B - Randomly selecting someone for a clinical trial who is a female.</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Disjoint Events</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Event A - Randomly selecting someone taking a statistics course.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Event B - Randomly selecting someone who is a female.</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Complementary Events and the Addition Rule</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use \(\bar{A}\) to indicate that event A does not occur. Common sense dictates this principle. We are certain with probability of 1 that either an event A occurs or does not occur, so it follows that |(P(A or \bar{A}) = 1. Because events \(A \text{and} \bar{A}\) must be disjoint, we can use the addition rule to express this principle as follows:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[P(A or \bar{A}) = P(A) + P(\bar{A}) = 1 \]</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Rule of Complementary Events</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[ P(A) + P(\bar{A}) = 1 \]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[ P(\bar{A}) = 1 - P(A) \]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[ P(A) = 1 - P(\bar{A}) \]</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Multiplication Rule</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">P(A and B) = P(event A occurs in a first trial and event B occurs in a second trial)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">P(B | A) represents the probability of event B occurring after it is assumed that event A has already occurred.</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Multiplication Rule</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">P(A and B) = P(event A occurs in a first trial and event B occurs in a second trial)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">P(B | A) represents the probability of event B occurring after it is assumed that event A has already occurred.</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Intuitive Multiplication Rule</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To find the probability that event A occurs in one trial and event B occurs in another trial, multiply the probability of event A by the probability of event B, but be sure that the probability of event B is found by assuming that event A has already occurred.</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Formal Multiplication Rule</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">P(A and B) = P(B | A)</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Independence and the Multiplication Rule</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two events A and B are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the occurrence of the other. Several events are independent if the occurrence of any does not affect the probabilities of the occurrence of the others. I A and B are not independent, they are said to be dependent.</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Sampling</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the world of statistics, sampling methods are critically important.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sampling with replacement: Selections are independent events.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sampling without replacement: Selections are dependent events.</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Treating Dependent Events as Independent</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When sampling without replacement and the sample size is no more than 5% of the size of the population, treat the selections as being independent, even though they are actually dependent.</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Redundancy</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The principle of redundancy is used to increase the reliability of many systems. Our eyes have passive redundancy in the sense that if one of them fails, we continue to see. An important finding of modern biology is that genes in an organism can often work in place of each other. Engineers often design redundant components so that the whole system will not fail because of the failure of a single component</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When randomly selecting an adult, A denotes the event of selecting someone with blue eyes. What do \(P(A)\) and \(P(\bar{A})\) represent?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(.P(A)\) represents the probability of selecting an adult with blue eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(P(\bar{A}) represents the probability of selecting an adult who does not have blue eyes.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are 15,958,866 adults in a region. If a polling organization randomly selects 1235 adults without replacement, are the selections independent or dependent? If the selections are dependent, can they be treated as independent for the purposes of calculations?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The selections are dependent because the selection is done without replacement.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, because the sample size is less than 5% of the population.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When randomly selecting an adult, let B represent the event of randomly selecting someone with type B blood. Write a sentence describing what the rule of complements below is telling us.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(P(B or \bar{B}) = 1\)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is certain that the selected adult has type B blood or does not have type B blood.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A research center poll showed that 76% of people believe that it is morally wrong to not report all income on tax returns.
