With just our eyes we probably<br>see a few thousand objects of varying intensity. They are mostly stars but there<br>are a few planets , comets, and meteors occasionally too. This is just our<br>galaxy. Our galaxy is a very small portion of the universe. </p><p><br>Ours and other galaxies are made up of stars, planets, dust, gas and quite possibly a <em><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/neutron-stars-and-black-holes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">black hole</a></em> for the most part. There are reportedly billion of other galaxies just like ours. Ours is fairly typical though, from what we can tell. Astronomers are still studying<br>what our overall shape is.<br><br>When we look at the night sky, we often see an extra bright band sweeping across<br>the sky. This is made up of a multitude of stars that are very far away. They<br>are so concentrated the band appears as its own light source in the sky. It's<br>truly incredible.</p><h3><br><strong>Structure of Galaxies</strong></h3><p>Galaxies can be several different shapes. In fact, the shape can be an indicator<br>of how that galaxy was formed. This in turn will reveal many of the processes<br>that happened during the formation.<br><br>Stars within any particular galaxy will usually be pretty far apart. They will<br>also not move far from the galactic plane until they get older. Older stars will<br>interact with other objects to a greater degree and start to wander slightly.   <br><br>There is a lot of dust that impedes our view. Because of this, radio astronomy<br>has been a key factor in discovering the shape of our own and other galaxies.<br>Our galaxy appears to be football shaped. I remember when that fact came out<br>that scientists were surprised as they expected it to be another shape.</p><h3><br><strong>The Milky Way Sky</strong></h3><p>On a clear and dark night, you can see a long cloudy band of stars. This is a<br>portion of our Milky Way galaxy. Why does it appear as a cloudy band of light?<br>This is a common question. It is because we are inside one of the spiral arms<br>of our galaxy. That band is us looking out from one of the arms. The spiral arms<br>appear patchy because of numerous gas clouds that cloud our vision.</p><h3><br><strong>Variable Stars</strong></h3><p>There fast became a need to measure everything around us. We did not know how<br>many stars were around us, how far away they were, or even what they were made<br>of. Astronomers even made some pretty bad guesses too. Finally, we discovered<br>variable stars. Many galaxies seem to have them and they helped Astronomers<br>greatly.<br><br>Variable stars are helpful because their brightness changes as a function of<br>time. With this information we can infer a great deal. That is why they are<br>helpful. The Cepheid variables are probably the most famous.</p><h3><br><strong>Mapping Our Galaxy With Variables</strong></h3><p>A cepheid is a pulsating variable star. The pulses happen because they are in a<br>later stage of life. The pulses are the stars contractions as they try to feed<br>off hydrogen. These pulses happen on a regular basis. Using this regularity, we<br>can tell the distance to them and relate to other astronomical objects. The<br>relationship between their periods and luminosities lets us derive the distance<br>to them. Since this is so useful, there is an ongoign search for pulsating<br>variable stars. Finding them lets us map out our galaxy. This is incredibly<br>useful and fun.</p><h3><br><strong>Motion of the Stars</strong></h3><p><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy-for-beginners-the-stars.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The stars</em></a> move and they do so constantly. This may be surprising to some since we<br>also know our planet moves in a constant orbit. In fact, our entire galactic<br>disk is rotating. The galactic disk includes all the stars, dust, and gas that<br>it contains.<br><br>Motion, of course, depends on how close you are to the galactic center. The<br>closer you are to the center the faster you would be moving. If you are very<br>far away then you will be moving slower than objects closer to the center.<br>There is a term that refers to this kind of motion and it is called differential<br>motion.</p><h3><br><strong>The Halo and Disk</strong></h3><p>Our galaxy consists of a disk and an outer halo of stars. These are different<br>components. Stars in the main disk have substantially different properties than<br>stars in the halo. This is due to age and how they were formed. The main disk<br>has stars of all ages and is tightly packed. The outer halo has very old stars<br>and is very sparsely populated. This halo is where we can find some globular<br>clusters also.</p><h3><br><strong>Formation of Galaxies</strong></h3><p>Ours and other galaxies start as a contracting cloud of gas. This is gas that<br>is becoming more cold and dense over time. This is what causes the contraction.<br>The gas was in big globs. There was no overall shape yet because the motion<br>between everything was pretty random at this point. this is the beginning of <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/how-stars-form.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>how stars form</em></a>. </p><p><br><br>As objects started interacting with each other, rotational motion started to<br>occur. This motion eventually flattened the gas and dust into a relatively<br>stable disk.<br><br>Over time, all the matter in the disk cooled even further. This is when star<br>formation ceased in our galaxy. Matter collected further into the plane of the<br>disk. There was a lot of heat loss and motion became less random.</p><h3><br><strong>Mass of a Galaxy</strong></h3><p>The mass of a galaxy is difficult to calculate accurately. However, we can get<br>decent estimates  by studying the motion of objects that are inside that<br>particular galaxy.<br>\( mass of galaxy = \frac{size^3}{period^2} \)<br>This is a real rough estimate, but it is a start. As can be seen, galaxies are<br>beyond large. This is why they exert such gravitational pull on objects close<br>to them.</p><h3><br><strong>Dark Matter</strong></h3><p>There has been lots of talk about dark matter in the last several years.<br>Journals have frequent and regular articles that discuss it. Most people are<br>just confused by it. At its face value, it does not make a lot of sense. I have<br>read it as being described as invisible. Others have said that we are walking<br>in a soup of it but we can't feel or see it. There have been many theories!<br><br>Another theory is that dark matter is all the hidden subatomic particles we<br>haven't discovered yet. This is at least interesting but I'm doubtful of it too.<br>The reason I am doubtful is that right now we don't even have a reason to<br>suspect there are that many particles floating around freely that violate the<br>laws of physics and go undetectable. Anyway, that is what I'm thinking, we will<br>see how things turn out.<br><br>So that leads us to the question: what is dark matter? I don't know any more<br>than the rest of the crackpots out there, including myself in that group, but I<br>am guessing it is just regular matter. This matter is probably very small and<br>there are probably dust clouds impeding view and blocking reflections from<br>light. Since this matter is also in deep space, it is very cold which is why we<br>can't detect radiation either. That is just my guess so take it with a grain of<br>salt. Everyone has a different guess. Some make a lot of sense such as brown<br>dwarfs and some are a bit more outlandish. Hopefully, we will find out more in<br>the coming years.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 3, 2024</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/astronomy/">Astronomy</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fintroduction-to-galaxies.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fintroduction-to-galaxies.html&amp;via=Science%20By%20Jason&amp;text=Introduction%20To%20Galaxies" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/inequalities-of-the-linear-kind.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Inequalities of the Linear Kind</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/classification-of-galaxies.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Classification Of Galaxies </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-08-07T18:07" class="feed__date">August 7, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/introduction-to-electronics.html" class="invert">Introduction to Electronics</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-08-07T17:41" class="feed__date">August 7, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/introduction-to-precalculus.html" class="invert">Introduction to Pre-Calculus</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-07-05T11:22" class="feed__date">July 5, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/introduction-to-the-solar-system.html" class="invert">Introduction To The Solar System</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></script></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Jason Moore 2021</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
