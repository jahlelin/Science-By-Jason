The set of the first components of each ordered pair is called the range. consider the following set of ordered pairs.<br>The first numbers in each pair are the first five natural numbers. The second number in each pair is twice that of the first. <br>\(1,2  2,4  3,6  4,8  5,10\)<br>The domain is (1,2,3,4,5)<br>The range is (2,4,6,8,10)<br><br>Note that each value in the domain is also known as an input or independent<br>variable. It is often labeled with a lowercase x. Each value in the range is<br>also known as an output value or dependent variable. It is often labeled with<br>a lowercase y. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Functions</strong></span><br>A function f is a relation that assigns a single value in the range to each<br>value in the domain. In other words, no x-values are repeated. For our example<br>that relates the first five natural numbers to numbers double their value, this<br>relation is a function because each element in the domain (1,2,3,4,5) is<br>paired with exactly one element in the range (2,4,6,8,10).<br><br>Now lets consider the set of ordered pairs that relates the terms even<br>and odd to the first five natural numbers.<br>(odd,1) (even,2)  (odd,3)  (even,4)  (odd,5)<br><br>Notice that each element in the domain (even,odd) is not paired with exactly<br>one element in the range, (1,2,3,4,5). For example, the term odd corresponds<br>to three values from the range (1,3,5) and the term even corresponds to two<br>values from the range (2,4). This violates the definition of a function,<br>so this relation is not a function. <br><br>A function is a relation in which each possible input value leads to exactly<br>one output value. We say the output is a function of the input. The input<br>values make up the domain, and the output values make up the range. <br><br>To decide if a relation is a function. identify the input values, identify<br>the output values. then: if each input value leads to only one output value,<br>classify the relationship as a function. If any input value leads to two or<br>more outputs, do not classify the relationship as a function.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Function Notation</strong></span><br>Once that we determine that a relationship is a function, we need to<br>display and define the functional relationship so that we can understand and use<br>them, and sometimes also so that we can program them into computers. There are<br>various ways of representing functions. A standard function notation is one<br>representation that facilitates working with functions. <br><br>To represent height is a function of age, we start by identifying the<br>descriptive variables "h" for height and "a" for age. The letters f,g, and h,<br>are often used to represent functions. <br><br>h is f of a - We name the function f, height is a function of age.<br>h=f(a) - We use parentheses to indicate the function input.<br>f(a) - We name the function f, the expression is read as "f of a".<br><br>Remember that we can use any letter to name the function. The notation<br>h(a) shows us that h depends on a. The value a must be put into the function h<br>to get a result. The parentheses indicate that age is input into the function,<br>they do not indicate multiplication. <br><br>We can also give an algebraic expression as the input to a function. For<br>example, f(a+b) means first a and b, and the result is the input for the<br>function f. The operations must be performed in this order to obtain the<br>correct result.<br><br>The notation y=f(x) defines a function named f. This is read as "y is a<br>function of x". The letter x represents the input value or independent<br>variable. The letter y or f(x) represents the output value or dependent<br>variable.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 1</strong></span><br>Determine if menu price lists are functions.<br>Is the price a function of the item?<br>Is the item a function of the price?<br><br>Solution: <br>Let's begin by considering the input as the items on the menu. The<br>output values are then the prices. Each item on the menu has only one price,<br>so the price is a function of the item. <br><br>Two items on the menu have the same price. If we consider the prices to be<br>the input values and the items to be the output, then the same input value<br>could have more than one output associated with it. So, the item is not a<br>function of the price.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 2</strong></span><br>Determine if class grade rules are functions<br>In a particular math class, the overall percent grade corresponds to a grade<br>point average. Is grade point average a function of the percent grade? Is the<br>percent grade a function of the grade point average?<br><br>Solution:<br>For any percent grade earned, there is an associated grade point average, so<br>the grade point average is a function of the percent grade. In other words, if<br>we input the percent grade, the output is a specific grade point average. <br><br>In the grading system given, there is a range of percent grades that<br>correspond to the same grade point average. For example, students who<br>receive a grade point average of 3.0 could have a variety of percent grades<br>ranging from 78 all the way to 86. Thus, the percent grade is not a function<br>of grade point average.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 3</strong></span><br>Using function notation for days in a month<br>Use function notation to represent a function whose input is the name of a<br>month and output is the number of days in that month. Assume that the domain<br>does not include leap years.<br><br>Solution:<br>The number of days in a month is a function of the name of the month, so if<br>we name the function f, we write days=f(month) or d-f(m). The name of the<br>month is the input to a rule that associates a specific number(the<br>output) with each input. For example, f(march)=31, because march has 31<br>days. The notation d-f(m) reminds us that the number of days, d(output), is<br>dependent on the name of the month, m(input). <br><br>Note that the inputs to a function do not have to be numbers. Function inputs<br>can be the names of people, labels of geometric objects, or any other<br>element that determines some kind of output. However, most of the functions we<br>will work with in this book will have numbers as inputs and outputs. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 4</strong></span><br>Interpreting function notation<br>A function N=f(y) gives the number of police officers, N, in a town in year y.<br>What does f(2005)=300 represent?<br><br>Solution:<br>When we read f(2005)=300, we see that the input year is 2005. The value for<br>the output, the number of police officers(N), is 300. Remember N=f(y). The<br>statement f(2005)=300 tells us that in the year 2005 there were 300 police<br>officers in town.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Representing Functions Using Tables</strong></span><br>A common method of representing functions is in the form of a table. The<br>table rows or columns display the corresponding input and output values. in<br>some cases, these values represent all we know about the relationship.; other<br>times, the table provides a few select examples from a more complete<br>relationship.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Finding Input and Output Values of a Function</strong></span><br>When we know an input value and want to determine the corresponding output<br>value for a function, we evaluate the function. Evaluating will always<br>produce one result because each input of a function corresponds to exactly<br>one output value.<br><br>When we know an output value and want to determine the input values that would<br>produce that output value, we set the output equal to the function's formula<br>and solve for the input. Solving can produce more than one solution because<br>different input values can produce the same output value. <br><br>When we have a function in formula form, it is usually a simple matter to<br>evaluate the function. For example, the function \(f(x)=5-3x^2\) can be<br>evaluated by squaring the input value, multiplying by 3, and then subtracting<br>the product from 5.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 6</strong></span><br>Evaluate \(f(x)=x^2+3x-4\) for x=2<br><br>Solution:<br>\(f(x)=(2)^2 + 3(2) - 4\)<br>\(f(x)=4+6-4\)<br>\(f(x)=6\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 7</strong></span><br>Given the function \(h(p)=p^2+2p\) evaluate h(4)<br><br>Solution:<br>To evaluate h(4), we substitute the value 4 for the input variable p in the<br>given function.<br>\(h(p)=p^2+2p\)<br>\(h(4)=4^2+2(4)\)<br>\(=16+8\)<br>\(=24\)<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 8</strong></span><br>Given the function \(h(p)=p^2+2p\) solve for h(p)=3<br><br>Solution:<br>\(h(p)=3\)<br>\(p^2+2p=3\)<br>\(p^2+2p-3=0\)<br>\((p+3)(p-1)=0\)<br>p=-3,1<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Evaluating Function Expressed in Formulas</strong></span><br>Some functions are defined by mathematical rules or procedures expressed in<br>equation form. If it is possible to express the function output with a<br>formula involving the input quantity, then we can define a function in<br>algebraic form. For example, the equation \(2n+6p=12\) expresses a functional<br>relationship between n and p. We can rewrite it to decide if p is a function<br>of n. <br><br>Given a function in equation form, write its algebraic formula:<br>1. Solve the equation to isolate the output variable on one side of the equal<br>sign, with the other side as an expression that involves only the input<br>variable.<br>2. Use all the usual algebraic methods for solving equations, such as adding<br>or subtracting the same quantity to or from both sides, or multiplying or<br>dividing both sides of the equation by the same quantity. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 9</strong></span><br>Finding the Algebraic form of a Function<br>Express the relationship \(2n+6p=12\) as a function \(p=f(n)\) if possible.<br><br>Solution:<br>To express the relationship in this form, we need to be able to write the<br>relationship where p is a function of n, which means writing it as<br>p=[expression involving n].<br>\(2n+6p=12\)<br>\(6p=12-2n\)<br>\(p=\frac{12-2n}{6}\)<br>\(p=\frac{12}{6} - \frac{2n}{6}\)<br>\(p=2-\frac{1}{3}n\)<br><br>It is important to note that not every relationship expressed by an equation<br>can also be expressed as a function with a formula.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 10</strong></span><br>Expressing the Equation of a Circle as a Function<br>does the equation \(x^2+y^2=1\) represent a function with x as input and y as<br>output? If so, express the relationship as a function \(y=f(x)\).<br><br>Solution:<br>First we subtract \(x^2\) from both sides.<br>\(y^2=1-x^2\)<br>Now we try to solve for y in this equation<br>\(y=\pm \sqrt{1-x^2}\)<br>\(y=+ \sqrt{1-x^2} \text{ and} - \sqrt{1-x^2}\)<br>We get two outputs corresponding to the same input, so this relationship cannot<br>be represented as a single function \(y=f(x)\)<br><br>Are there relationships expressed by an equation that do represent a function<br>but which still cannot be represented by an algebraic formula?<br>Yes this can happen. For example, given the equation \(x=y+2^y\), if we want<br>to express y as a function of x, there is no simple algebraic formula<br>involving only x that equals y. However, each x does determine a unique value<br>for y, and there are mathematical procedures by which y can be found to any<br>desired accuracy. In this case, we say that the equation gives an<br>implicit rule for y as a function of x, even though the formula cannot be<br>written explicitly.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Evaluating a Function Given in Tabular Form</strong></span><br>As we saw above, we can represent functions in tables. Conversely, we can use<br>information in tables to write functions, and we can evaluate functions using<br>the tables. <br><br>Given a function represented by a table, identify specific output and input<br>values:<br>1. Find the given input in the row of input values<br>2. Identify the corresponding output value paired with that input value<br>3. Find the given output values in the row or column of output values, noting<br>every time that output value appears.<br>4. Identify the input value or values corresponding to the given output value.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 11</strong></span><br>Evaluating and Solving a Tabular Function<br>1. Evaluate g(3)<br>2. Solve \(g(n)=6\)<br><br>Solution:<br>Evaluating g(3) means determining the output value of the function g for the<br>input value of n=3. The table output value corresponding to n=3 is<br>7, so g(3)=7.<br><br>Solving g(n)=6 means identifying the input values n, that produce an output<br>value of 6. When we input 2 into the function g, our output is 6. When we<br>input 4 into the function g, our output is also 6.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Finding Function Values From a Graph</strong></span><br>Evaluating a function using a graph requires finding the corresponding value<br>for a given input value, only in this case, we find the output value by<br>looking at the graph. Solving a function equation using a graph requires<br>finding all instances of the given output value on the graph and observing the<br>corresponding input values.<br>1. Evaluate f(2)<br>2. Solve f(x)=4<br><br>Solution:<br>1. To evaluate f(2), locate the point on the curve where x=2, then read the<br>y-coordinate of that point. The point has coordinates of (2,1) so f(2)=1.<br>2. To solve f(x)=4, we find the output value 4 on the vertical axis. moving<br>horizontally along the line y=4, we locate two points of the curve with output<br>value 4:(-1,4) and (3,4). These points represent the two solutions to f(x)=4:<br>-1 or 3. This means f(-1)=4 and f(3)=4, or when the input is -1 or 3, the<br>output is 4.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Determining Whether a Function is One-to-One</strong></span><br>Some functions have a given output value that corresponds to two or<br>more input values. For example, in the stock chart shown, the stock price<br>was $1000 on five different dates, meaning that there were five different input<br>values that all resulted in the same output value of $1000.<br><br>However, some functions have only one input value for each output value, as<br>well as having only one output for each input. We call these functions<br>one-to-one functions. As an example, consider a school that uses only letter<br>grades and decimal equivalents.<br><br>This grading system represents a one to one function, because each letter input<br>yields one particular grade point average output and each grade point average<br>corresponds to one input letter.<br><br>To visualize this concept, let's look again at the two simple functions<br>sketched. The function in part 1 shows a relationship that is not a one to one<br>function because inputs q and r both give output n. The function in part 2<br>shows a relationship that is a one to one function because each input is<br>associated with a single output.<br><br>A one to one function is a function in which each output value corresponds<br>to exactly one input value.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 13</strong></span><br>Determining Whether a Relationship is a One to One function<br>Is the area of a circle a function of its radius? if yes, is the function one<br>to one?<br><br>Solution:<br>A circle of radius r has a unique area measure given by \(A=\pi r^2\) for any<br>input r, there is only one output. The area is a function of radius r.<br><br>If the function is one to one, the output value, the area, must correspond to<br>a unique input value, the radius. Any area measure A is given by the formula<br>\(A=\pi r^2\). Because areas and radii are positive numbers, there is exactly<br>one solution: \(\sqrt{A}{\pi}\). So the area of a circle is a one to one<br>function of the circle's radius. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Using the Vertical Line Test</strong></span><br>As we have seen in some examples above, we can represent a function<br>using a graph. Graphs display a great many input-output pairs in a small<br>space. The visual information they provide often makes relationships easier to<br>understand. by convention, graphs are typically constructed with the<br>input values along the horizontal axis and the output values along the vertical<br>axis.<br><br>The most common graphs name the input value y, and we say y is a function of x,<br>or y=f(x) when the function is named f. The graph of the function is the set<br>of all points (x,y) in the plane that satisfies the equation y=f(x). If the<br>function is defined for only a few input values, then the graph of the function<br>is only a few points, where the x-coordinate of each point is an input value<br>and the y-coordinate of each point is the corresponding output<br>value. for example, the black dots on the graph tell us that f(0)=2 and<br>f(6)=1. However, the set of all points (x,y) satisfying y=f(x) is a<br>curve. The curve includes (0,2) and (6,1) because the curve passes through<br>those points.<br><br>The vertical line test can be used to determine whether a graph<br>represents a function. If we can draw any vertical line that intersects a<br>graph more than once, then the graph does not define a function because a<br>function has only one output value for each input value.<br><br>Given a graph, use the vertical line test to determine if the graph represents a<br>function.<br>1. Inspect the graph to see if any vertical line drawn would intersect the curve<br>more than once.<br>2. If there is any such line, determine that the graph does not represent a<br>function.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 14</strong></span><br>Applying the vertical line test<br>Which of the graphs represent a function y=f(x)?<br><br>Solution:<br>If any vertical line intersects a graph more than once, the relation<br>represented by the graph is not a function. Notice that any vertical line<br>would pass through only one point of the two graphs shown in parts a and b.<br>From this we can conclude that these two graphs represent functions. The<br>third graph does not represent a function because, at most x-values, a vertical<br>line would intersect the graph at more than one point.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Using the Horizontal line test</strong></span><br>Once we have determined that a graph defines a function, an easy way to<br>determine if it is a one to one function is to use the horizontal line test. Draw<br>horizontal lines through the graph. If any horizontal line intersects the graph<br>more than once, then the graph does not represent a one to one function.<br><br>Given a graph of a function, use the horizontal line test to determine if the<br>graph represents a one to one function.<br>1. Inspect the graph to see if any horizontal line drawn would intersect the<br>curve more than once.<br>2. If there is any such line, determine that the function is not one to<br>one.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 15</strong></span><br>Applying the Horizontal Line Test<br>Consider the functions shown. Are either of the functions one to one?<br><br>Solution:<br>1. The function in part 1 is not one to one. The horizontal line shown<br>intersects the graph of the function at two points.<br>2. The function in part 2 is one to one. Any horizontal line will intersect a<br>diagonal line at most once.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Identifying Basic Toolkit Functions</strong></span><br>In this section, we will be exploring functions-the shapes of their graphs,<br>their unique characteristics, their algebraic formulas, and how to<br>solve problems with them. When learning to read, we start with the alphabet.<br>When learning to do arithmetic, we start with numbers. When working with<br>functions, it is similarly helpful to have a base set of building block<br>elements. We call these our toolkit functions, which form a set of basic named<br>functions for which we known the graph, formula, and special properties. Some<br>of these functions are programmed to individual buttons on many<br>calculators. For these definitions, we will use the x as the input variable and<br>y=f(x) as the output variable.<br><br>We will see these toolkit functions, combinations of toolkit functions, their<br>graphs, and their transformations frequently throughout this book. It<br>will be very helpful if we can recognize these toolkit functions and their<br>features quickly by name, formula, graph, and basic table properties. The<br>graphs and sample table values are included with each function shown. </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 26, 2024</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/precalculus/">precalculus</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Ffunctions-and-notation-in-precalculus.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Ffunctions-and-notation-in-precalculus.html&amp;via=Science%20By%20Jason&amp;text=Functions%20and%20Notation%20in%20Precalculus" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/linear-equations-with-three-variables.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Linear Equations With Three Variables</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/forces-in-physics.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Forces In Physics </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-07-29T13:05" class="feed__date">July 29, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/rates-of-change-in-precalculus.html" class="invert">Rates of Change in Precalculus</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-07-28T17:47" class="feed__date">July 28, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/domain-and-range-in-precalculus.html" class="invert">Domain and Range in Precalculus</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-08-13T19:55" class="feed__date">August 13, 2020</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/understanding-functions-in-algebra.html" class="invert">Understanding Functions In Algebra</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></script></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Jason Moore 2021</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
