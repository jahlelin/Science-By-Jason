This plan must include the question or questions to be answered as well as an appropriate method of data collection and analysis. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Methods Of Data Collection</strong></span><br>First, we need to introduce some terms and concepts.<br>A population is the entire group of individuals or items that we are interested in.<br>A frame is a list of all the members from which the sample is to be taken. This is usually the same as the population.<br>A sample is the part of the population that is actually being examined.<br>A sample survey is the process of collecting information from a sample. Information obtained from the sample is usually used to make inferences about a population parameters.<br>A census is the process of collecting information from all the units in a<br>population. It is feasible to do a census if the population is small and the<br>process of getting information does not destroy or modify units of the<br>population. A census is often too costly and sometimes too damaging to the<br>population being studied. We usually have to take samples instead. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Experiments and Observational Studies</strong></span><br>An experiment is a planned activity that results in measurements. In an<br>experiment, the experimenter creates differences in the variables involved in<br>the study and then observes the effects of such differences on the resulting<br>measurements. <br><br>An observational study is an activity in which the experimenter observes the<br>relationships among variables rather than creating them. Experiments have some<br>advantages, but unfortunately, it is impossible or unethical to conduct an<br>experiment. Sometimes we must use an observational study. <br><br>One of the problems with observational studies is that their results often<br>cannot be generalized to a population, because many observational studies use<br>samples that are not representative of the population at interest.  These<br>samples might simply be easiest to obtain. Another problem is that of<br>confounding factors. These occur when the two variables of interest are related<br>to a third variable instead of just to each other. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Planning and Conducting Surveys</strong></span><br>There are many methods of getting a sample from the population. Some sampling<br>methods are better than others. Biased sampling methods result in values that<br>are systematically different from the population values or systematically favor<br>certain outcomes. <br><br>Judgmental sampling, samples of convenience, and volunteer samples are some of<br>the methods that generally result in biased outcomes. Sampling methods that are<br>based on a probabilistic selection of samples such as simple random sampling,<br>generally result in unbiased outcomes. <br><br>Judgmental sampling makes use of a nonrandom approach to determine which item<br>of the population is to be selected in the sample. The approach is entirely<br>based on the judgement of the person selecting the sample. <br><br>Using a sample of convenience is another method that can result in biased<br>outcomes. Samples of convenience are easy to obtain. <br><br>Volunteer samples, in which the subjects choose to be part of the sample, may<br>also result in biased outcomes.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Simple Random Sampling</strong></span><br>Simple random sampling is a process of obtaining a sample from a population in<br>which each member has an equal chance of being selected. In this type of sample,<br>there is no bias or preference for one individual over another. Simple random<br>samples, also known as random samples, are obtained in two different ways:<br>sampling with replacement from a finite population and sampling without<br>replacement from an infinite population. <br><br>To select a simple random sample from a population, we need to use some kind of<br>chance mechanism. <br><br>Beside simple random sampling, there are other sampling procedures that make<br>use of a random phenomenon to get a sample from a population. In a systematic<br>sampling procedure, the first item is selected at random from the first k items<br>in the frame, and then every kth item is included in the sample. This method is<br>popular among biologists, foresters, environmentalists, and marine scientists. <br><br>In stratified random sampling, the population is divided into groups called<br>strata, and a simple random sample is selected from each stratum. Strata are<br>homogeneous groups of population units. The units in a given stratum are similar<br>in some characteristics, whereas those in different strata differ in those<br>characteristics. <br><br>In proportional sampling, the population is divided into groups called strata,<br>and a simple random sample of size proportional to the stratum size is selected<br>from each stratum. Proportional sampling is the preferred method of stratified<br>sampling. <br><br>In cluster sampling, a population is divided into existing, non-homogeneous<br>groups called clusters. A simple random sample of clusters is obtained, and all<br>individuals within the selected clusters are included in the sample. In order to<br>safely use cluster sampling, each cluster should be representative of the<br>population as a whole. Cluster sampling is often used to reduce the cost of<br>obtaining a sample, especially when the population is large.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Bias In Surveys</strong></span><br>For a survey to produce reliable results, it must be properly designed and<br>conducted. Sample should be selected using a proper randomization technique. A<br>nonrandom selection will limit the generalizability of the results. Furthermore,<br>interviewers should be trained in proper interviewing techniques. The attitude<br>and behavior of the interviewer should not lead to any specific answers, because<br>this would result in a biased outcome. Questions should be carefully worded, as<br>the wording of a question can affect the response, and leading questions should<br>be avoided. <br><br>A survey is biased if it systematically favors certain outcomes. Response bias<br>occurs when a respondent provides an answer that is either factually wrong or<br>does not accurately reflect his or her true opinion. <br><br>Non-response bias may occur if the person selected for an interview cannot be<br>contacted or refuses to answer. If such individuals are different, as a group,<br>from those who are eventually interviewed, then the results may not accurately<br>reflect the whole population.<br><br>Under-coverage bias may occur if part of the population is left out of the<br>selection process. <br><br>Wording effect bias may occur if confusing or leading questions are asked. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Planning Experiments</strong></span><br>A dependent or response variable is the variable to be measured in the<br>experiment. An independent or explanatory variable is a variable that may<br>explain the differences in responses. We are interested in studying the<br>effects of independent variables on dependent variables.<br><br>An experimental unit is the smallest unit of the population to which a<br>treatment is applied. A confounding variable is a variable whose effect on the<br>response cannot be separated from the effect of the explanatory variable. In<br>properly constructed experiments, an experimenter tries to control confounding<br>variables. Confounding can be an even more serious problem in observational<br>studies because the experimenter has no control over the confounding variables. <br><br>A factor is a variable whose effect on the response is of interest in the<br>experiment. Factors are of two types- qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative<br>is where the data is in non-numerical groups. Quantitative is where the data can<br>be measured numerically. <br><br>Levels are the values of a factor used in the experiment. An experiment can have<br>one or more factors. The number of levels used in the experiment may differ from<br>factor to factor. Treatments are the factor-level combination used in the<br>experiment. If the experiment has only one factor, then all the levels of that<br>factor are considered treatments of the experiment. <br><br>A control group is a group of experimental units similar to all the other<br>experimental units except that it is not given any treatment. A control group is<br>used to establish the baseline response expected from experimental units if no<br>treatment is given. <br><br>A placebo groups is a control group that receives a treatment that looks and<br>feels similar to an experimental treatment but is expected to have no effect. A<br>placebo is a medicine that looks exactly like the real medicine but does not<br>contain any active ingredients. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Single and Double Blind Experiments</strong></span><br>Similarly, it is possible that measurements or subject interaction will be<br>biased if the person taking the measurements knows whether a person received a<br>placebo or not. Blinding technique is used in medical experiments to prevent<br>such a bias. The blinding technique can be used in two different fashions-<br>double blinding and single blinding. In a single blind experiment, either the<br>person does not know which treatment he or she is receiving or the person<br>measuring the patient's reaction does not know which treatment was given. In<br>a double blind experiment, both the patient and the person measuring the<br>patient's reaction do not know which treatment the patient was given. <br><br>Double blind experiments are preferred, but in certain situations they simply<br>cannot be conducted. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Randomization</strong></span><br>The technique of randomization is used to average the effects of extraneous<br>factors on responses. In other words, it balances the effects of factors you<br>cannot see.<br><br>If each experimental unit is supposed to receive only one treatment, then which<br>experimental unit receives which treatment should be determined randomly. If<br>each experimental unit is supposed to receive all treatments, then the order of<br>treatments should be determined randomly for each experimental unit. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Blocking</strong></span><br>The technique of blocking is used to control the effects of known factors. A<br>block is a group of homogeneous experimental units. Experimental units in a<br>block are similar in certain characteristics, whereas those in different blocks<br>differ in those characteristics. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Replication</strong></span><br>Replication refers to the process of giving a certain treatment numerous times<br>in an experiment, or even repeating an experiment multiple times. Replication<br>reduces chance variation among results. It also allows us to estimate chance<br>variation among results. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Completely Randomized Design</strong></span><br>In a completely randomized design, treatments are assigned randomly to all<br>experimental units, or experimental units are assigned randomly to all<br>treatments. This design can compare any number of treatments. There are<br>advantages in having an equal number of experimental units for each treatment.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Randomized Block Design</strong></span><br>If the treatments are the only systematic differences present in the<br>experiment, then the completely randomized design is best for comparing the<br>responses. But often there are other factors affecting responses. Unless they<br>are controlled, the results will be biased. One way to control the effects of<br>known extraneous factors is to form groups of similar units called blocks. In a<br>randomized block design, all experimental units allows the experimenter to<br>account for systematic differences in responses due to a known factor and leads<br>to more precise conclusions from the experiment. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Matched-Pairs Design</strong></span><br>If there are only two treatments to be compared in the presence of a blocking<br>factor, then you should use a randomized paired comparison design. This can be<br>designed in different ways. Form two or more blocks of two experimental units<br>each. Experimental units within each block should be matched by some relevant<br>characteristics. Within each block, toss a coin to assign two treatments to the<br>two experimental units randomly. Each block will have one experimental and one<br>control unit. Because both experimental units are similar to each other except<br>for the treatment received, the differences in responses can be attributed to<br>the differences in treatments. This type of experiment is called a matched-pairs<br>design. <br><br>Alternatively, each experimental unit can be used as its own block. Assign both<br>treatments to each experimental unit, but in random order. To control the effect<br>of the order of treatment, randomly determine the order. With each experimental<br>unit, toss a coin to decide whether the order of treatments should be treatment1<br>or treatment2. Because both treatments are assigned to the same experimental<br>unit, the individual effects of experimental units are nullified, and the<br>differences in responses can attributed to the differences in treatments. <br><br>Control groups allow us to see what would happen to experimental units over<br>time. Placebo groups go above and beyond control groups by implementing an<br>intervention or treatment that is similar to the target intervention or<br>treatment. This helps us account for even more external factors.<br><br><br></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 29, 2024</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/statistics/">Statistics</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fmethods-of-data-collection-in-statistics.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fmethods-of-data-collection-in-statistics.html&amp;via=Science%20By%20Jason&amp;text=Methods%20Of%20Data%20Collection%20In%20Statistics" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/projectile-motion-in-physics.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Projectile Motion In Physics</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/probability-in-statistics.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Probability In Statistics </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-09-05T12:56" class="feed__date">September 5, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/working-with-tables-and-graphs-in-statistics.html" class="invert">Working with Tables and Graphs in Statistics</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-08-30T22:13" class="feed__date">August 30, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/what-statistics-is-all-about.html" class="invert">What Statistics Is All About</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-07-11T21:28" class="feed__date">July 11, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/organization-of-data-in-statistics.html" class="invert">Organization of Data in Statistics</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></script></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Jason Moore 2021</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
