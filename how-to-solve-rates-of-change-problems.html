When you put a curve on a graph it will have an infinite number of points between its starting and ending points. If you take any two points on this curve you can draw a straight line to connect them. This straight line might be perfectly flat with respect to the x-axis, go up, or go down.</p><p>The line that we drew will have a certain length according to the points on the graph. Length will equal the number of points on the graph that it moves through then. The line will also have a certain amount of points it moves up or down. This value could be 0, positive, or negative. If you divide this change in y by the change in x you will get the slope of the curve in between those two points. This will be important to remember as we move towards <a href="http://sciencebyjason.com/beginning-calculus-problems-with-limits/">limits</a> eventually.</p><h3>Problem 1</h3><p>Find the slope of the curve at the point (1,5).</p><p>$$ y= 3x^2 -2x +4 $$</p><p>The curve looks like this.</p><figure class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4827"><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/26/rate-of-change-0-1-1024x638.png" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/26/responsive/rate-of-change-0-1-1024x638-xs.png 300w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/26/responsive/rate-of-change-0-1-1024x638-sm.png 480w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/26/responsive/rate-of-change-0-1-1024x638-md.png 768w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/26/responsive/rate-of-change-0-1-1024x638-lg.png 1024w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/26/responsive/rate-of-change-0-1-1024x638-xl.png 1360w ,https://ScienceByJason.com/media/posts/26/responsive/rate-of-change-0-1-1024x638-2xl.png 1600w" alt="rate of change 1" data-aspectratio="1.605016" width="1024" height="638"></figure><p>We will use the difference formula to solve basic derivatives for now.</p><p>$$ \frac{3(x + \bigtriangleup x)^2 - 2(x + \bigtriangleup x) + 4 - (3x^2 -2x + 4)}{\bigtriangleup x} $$</p><p>Lets multiple out these terms.</p><p>$$ \frac{3x^2 + 6x\bigtriangleup x + 3(\bigtriangleup x)^2 -2x - 2\bigtriangleup x +4 -3x^2 + 2x - 4} {\bigtriangleup x} $$</p><p>We can simplify this a lot now.</p><p>$$ \frac{6x\bigtriangleup x + 3(\bigtriangleup x)^2 - 2\bigtriangleup x} {\bigtriangleup x} $$</p><p>Further reducing this give us:</p><p>$$ 6x + 3\bigtriangleup x - 2 $$</p><p>This gives us:</p><p>$$ 6x - 2 $$</p><p>Our point we are evaluating is (1,5).

However, there is more to solving this.</p><p>What we are really saying is this.</p><p>$$ \bigtriangleup y = f(x + \bigtriangleup x) - f(x) $$</p><p>The original problem tells us that:</p><p>$$ y = \frac{2x}{x + 1} $$</p><p>Remember that  y = f(x) and we are trying to find the change in y. So the change in y is:</p><p>$$ f( x + \bigtriangleup x) = \frac{2(x + \bigtriangleup x)}{x + \bigtriangleup x + 1} $$</p><p>Now we substitute what we know into this so far.</p><p>$$ \bigtriangleup y = \frac{ 2x  + 2\bigtriangleup x}{x + \bigtriangleup x + 1} - \frac{2x}{x + 1} $$</p><p>Lets start by combining the terms:</p><p>$$ \bigtriangleup y = \frac{(2x + 2 * \bigtriangleup x)(x + 1) - 2x (x + \bigtriangleup x + 1)}{(x + 1)(x + \bigtriangleup x + 1)} $$</p><p>This of course can be simplified. Look for the terms that cancel.</p><p>$$ \bigtriangleup y = \frac{2 * \bigtriangleup x}{(x \bigtriangleup x + 1)(x + 1)(\bigtriangleup x)} $$</p><p>We now get a much better looking version.</p><p>$$ \frac{2}{(x + \bigtriangleup x + 1)(x + 1)} $$</p><p>Since this limit is approaching 0 we will try substituting 0 for change the in x value and see what kind of answer we get.</p><p>$$ \frac{\bigtriangleup y}{\bigtriangleup x} = \frac{2}{(x + 1)^2} $$</p><p>Now substitute 2 for x and see if we get an answer that makes sense. It looks good so I am happy with that.

They can be quite interesting. You can see how the problems start from simple to to slightly harder. You should notice, however, that the calculus portion never gets more difficult. It is the same. What gets harder is the <a href="http://www.algebra-class.com/rate-of-change.html">algebra</a> and how to manipulate the equations that you have to work with. So keep your algebra skills sharp and this is easy stuff. later on <a href="http://sciencebyjason.com/one-sided-limits-of-calculus/">one-sided limits</a> will test your knowledge a bit more but they are really more of the same.
