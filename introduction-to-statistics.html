Populations are defined by what a researcher is studying and can come in all shapes and sizes.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A frame is a list containing all members of the population.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Population parameters are facts about the population. Since parameters are descriptions of the population, a population can have many parameters. Parameters can be averages, percentages, minimums, or maximums. For a specific population at a specific point in time, population parameters do not change.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sample is a subset of the population which is used to gain insight about the population. Samples are used to represent a larger group, the population. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A statistic is a fact or characteristic about the sample. For any given sample a statistic is a fixed number. Statistics are used as estimates of population parameters. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A process is a method for obtaining a desired result. The idea of a process is closely tied to quality control. In order to improve a process, there must be an understanding of how the process is currently performing. This required definition and measurement of the process. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The science of statistics is divided into two categories, descriptive and inferential. Descriptive methods describe and summarize data. Descriptive statistics is the collection, organization, and presentation of data.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The objective of inferential statistics is to make reasonable guesses about the population characteristics using sample data. </span></p><p id="mcetoc_1h0e0qib123g" class="align-center"><br><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Collecting and Analyzing Data</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of becoming a problem solver and user of statistics is developing an ability to appraise the quality of measurements. When you encounter data, consider whether the concept under study is adequately reflected by the proposed measurements, is the data measured accurately, and is there a sufficient quantity of the data to draw a reasonable conclusion.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measurement and data are an integral part of science. Methods have been developed to solve research problems. Gather information about the phenomenon being studied. On the basis of the data, formulate a preliminary generalization or hypothesis. Collect further data to test the hypothesis. If the data and other subsequent experiments support the hypothesis, it becomes a law.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two ways to obtain data, observation and controlled experiments. In a statistical analysis, it is usually not possible to recover from poorly measured concepts or badly collected measurements. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A response variable measures the outcome of interest in a study. An explanatory variable causes or explains changes in a response variable. Isolating the effects of one variable on another means anticipating potentially confounding variables and designing a controlled experiment to produce data in which the values of the confounding variable are regulated.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Observational data comes about from measuring things. They can be extremely valuable. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the statistical information presented to us is in the form of surveys. So, it is important to understand them and how they are done. In some cases, the purpose of a survey is purely descriptive. However, in many cases the researcher is interested in discovering a relationship.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data in which the observations are restricted to a set of values that possess gaps is called discrete. Data that can take on any value within some interval is called continuous. The quality of data is referred to as its level of measurement. When analyzing data, you must be exceedingly conscious of the data’s level of measurement because many statistical analyses can only be applied to data that possess a certain level of measurement. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data that represents whether a variable possesses some characteristic is called nominal. Ordinal data represents categories that have some associated order. Note that ordinal data is also nominal, but it also possesses the additional property of ordinality. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the data can be ordered and the arithmetic difference is meaningful, the data is interval. An example of interval data is temperature. Interval data is numerical data that possesses both the property of ordinality and the interval property. Ratio data is similar to interval data, except that it has a meaningful zero point and the ratio of two data points is meaningful. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qualitative data is data measured on a nominal or ordinal scale. Quantitative data is measured on an interval or ratio scale. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time series data originates as measurements usually taken from some process over equally spaced intervals of time. Time series data originate from processes. Processes can be divided into two categories: stationary and nonstationary. All time series that are interesting vary, and the nature of the variability determines how the process is characterized. In a stationary process the time series varies around some central value and has approximately the same variation over the series. In a nonstationary process, the time series possess a trend, the tendency for the series to either increase or decrease over time. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cross-sectional data are measurements created at approximately the same period of time. </span></p><p id="mcetoc_1h53uv6d47" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Organization of Data in Statistics</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A frequency distribution is a summary technique that organizes data into classes and provides in tabular form a list of the classes along with the number of observations in each class.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process begins by refining information. An analyst will do this. He takes raw data and organizes that data. This is done by counting the number of observations in each classification. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A frequency distribution is a good way to handle large amounts of data. With it, we can see the overall structure of the data.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two steps in creating a frequency distribution:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose the classifications</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Counting the number in each class</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graphs are important because they put information in visual form. While individual data can be lost, this is more than made up for by a nice graph. Use some type of graphing software to do this easily. Lots of different programs are available to create nice looking graphs these days. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Bar Charts</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bar chart is a simple graph in which the length of each bar corresponds to the number of observations in a category.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are a good presentation tool and helpful in showing the differences in magnitude. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a bar chart can get complicated. You should think about size, color, and labeling. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Pie Charts</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pie charts can represent the same information as a bar chart. The slices in a pie chart are proportional to the total in each category. You can easily compare the total of each category to the total overall. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your data is qualitative, choosing categories is pretty easy. However, when your data is qualitative, choosing those categories is more complicated. The reason is that your choices often reflect how others will interpret the data. So, you have to be careful when doing this. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing the number of categories is your choice and should depend on the amount of data available. You want enough categories to make the comparisons meaningful but not so many that it is hard to understand. Each situation will be different in this regard. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Relative Frequency Distribution</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This represents the total observations in a category. It enables a person to view the number in each category in relation to the total number of observations. Another thing it does is change the frequency in each category to a proportion so we can compare data sets easier. I looks like this:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[ \text{relative frequency} = \frac{\text{number in category}}{\text{total number}} \]</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Cumulative Frequency Distribution</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This gives a person the ability to quickly look at any category and see the number of observations and how they are related. The cumulative frequency is the sum of the frequency of a particular category and all preceding categories.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Cumulative Relative Frequency</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cumulative relative frequency is the proportion of observations in a particular category and all preceding categories. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Histograms</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A histogram is used frequently and reveals the distribution of data. It is a bar graph of the frequency in which the height of each bar corresponds to the frequency of the category. Each category is represented by a vertical bar whose height is proportional to the frequency of the interval. The horizontal boundaries of each vertical bar correspond to the category endpoints. Once the frequency distribution has been calculated, all the information necessary for plotting a histogram is available. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Stem and Leaf Display</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stem and leaf display is a mix of methods. The display is similar to a histogram but the data remains usable to the user. It is useful for ordering and detecting patterns in the data. In other words, the raw data is not lost in the graph. It is similar to a histogram but the data remains visible. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Ordered Array</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An ordered array is a listing of all the data in either increasing or decreasing magnitude. Data listed in increasing order is said to be listed in rank order. If listed in decreasing order, it is listed in reverse rank order. Listing data in an order is very useful and usually done. It allows you to scan the data quickly for the largest and smallest values. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Dot Plots</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dot plot is a graph where each data value is plotted as a point. If there are multiple entries, they are plotted above each other. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Time Series Data</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A time series plot graphs data using time as the horizontal axis. </span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1h8lbggrsf" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Statistical and Critical Thinking</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surveys provide data that enable us to improve products or services. Surveys guide political candidates, shape business practices, influence social media, and affect many aspects of our lives. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A voluntary response sample is a sample in which respondents themselves decide whether to participate. Those with a strong interest in the topic are more likely to participate. Sample data must be collected in an appropriate way, such as through a process of random selection. If sample data are not collected in an appropriate way, the data may be so completely useless that no amount of statistical torturing can salvage them.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When using methods of statistics with sample data to form conclusions about a population, it is absolutely essential to collect sample data in a way that is appropriate. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data are collections of observations, such as measurements, genders, or survey responses. A single data value is called a datum. The term data is plural.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statistics is the science of planning studies and experiments, obtaining data, and organizing, summarizing, presenting, analyzing, and interpreting those data and then drawing conclusions based on them. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A population is the complete collection of all measurements or data that are being considered. Typically, a population is the complete collection of data that we would like to make inferences about. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A census is the collection of data from every member of the population.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sample is a subcollection of members selected from a population.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because populations are often very large, a common objective of the use of statistics is to obtain data from a sample and then use those data to form a conclusion about the population.</span></p><p><br><br></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A voluntary response sample is one in which the respondents themselves decide whether to be included.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The word statistics is derived from the Latin word status, meaning state. Early uses of statistics involved compilations of data and graphs describing various aspects of a state or country. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following types of polls are common examples of voluntary response samples. By their very nature, all are seriously flawed because we should not make conclusions about a population on the basis of samples with a strong possibility of bias.</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet polls: people online can decide whether to respond.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mail-in polls: in which people can decide whether to reply.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telephone polls in which newspaper, radio, or television announcements ask that you call a special number to respond.</span></li></ol><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Analyze</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After completing our preparation by considering the context, source, and sampling method, we begin to analyze the data.</span></p><p><strong>Graph and Explore</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An analysis should begin with appropriate graphs and explorations of data.</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Apply Statistical Methods</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good statistical analysis does not require strong computational skills. A good statistical analysis does require using common sense and paying careful attention to sound statistical methods.</span></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Conclude</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final step in our statistical process involves conclusions, and we should develop an ability to distinguish between statistical significance and practical significance. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statistical significance is achieved in a study when we get a result that is very unlikely to occur by chance. A common criterion is that we have statistical significance if the likelihood of an event occurring by chance is 5 percent or less. Getting 98 girls in 100 random births is statistically significant because such an extreme outcome is not likely to result from random chance. Getting 52 girls in 100 births is not statistically significant because that event could easily occur with random chance.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Practical significance is when it is possible that some treatment or finding is effective, but common sense might suggest that the treatment or finding does not make enough of a difference to justify its use or to be practical.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Misleading Conclusions</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When forming a conclusion based on a statistical analysis, we should make statements that are clear even to those who have no understanding of statistics and its terminology. We should carefully avoid making statements not justified by statistical analysis. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Sample Data Reported</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When collecting data from people, it is better to take measurements yourself instead of asking subjects to report results. Ask people what they weigh and you are likely to get their desired weights, not their actual weight. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Loaded Questions</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If survey questions are not worded carefully, the results of a study can be misleading. Survey questions can be loaded or intentionally worded to elicit a desired response. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Order of Questions</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes survey questions are unintentionally loaded by such factors as the order of the items being considered. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Nonresponse</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A nonresponse occurs when someone either refuses to respond to a survey question or is unavailable. When people are asked survey questions, some firmly refuse to answer. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Percentages</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To find a percentage of an amount, replace the % symbol with division by 100, and then interpret “of” to be multiplication. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">6% of 1200 responses = \(\frac{6}{100} * 1200 = 72 \)</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Decimal to Percentage</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To convert from a decimal to a percentage, multiply by 100%.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[ 0.25 \rightarrow 0.25 * 100% = 25% \]</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Fraction to Percentage</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To convert from a fraction to a percentage, divide the denominator into the numerator to get an equivalent decimal number. Then multiply by 100 percent.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[ \frac{}3}{4} = 0.75 \rightarrow 0.75 * 100% = 75% \]</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Percentage to Decimal</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To convert from a percentage to a decimal number, replace the % symbol with division by 100. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[ 85% = \frac{85}{100} = 0.85 \]</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A parameter is a numerical measurement describing some characteristic of a population.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A statistic is a numerical measurement describing some characteristic of a sample.</span></p><p><br><br></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we have more than one statistic, we have statistics. Another meaning of statistics is the science of planning studies and experiments; obtaining data, organizing, summarizing, presenting, analyzing, and interpreting those data.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some data are numbers representing counts or measurements, whereas others are attributes that are not counts or measurements. Quantitative data consist of numbers representing counts or measurements. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Categorical data consist of names or labels. Categorical data are sometimes coded with numbers, with those numbers replacing names. Although such numbers might appear to be quantitative, they are actually categorical data. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Include Units of Measurement</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With quantitative data, it is important to use the appropriate units of measurement, such as dollars, hours, feet, or meters. We should carefully observe information given about the units of measurement, such as all amounts are in thousands of dollars or all units are in kilograms. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Discrete or Continuous</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quantitative data can be further described by distinguishing between discrete and continuous types. Discrete data result when the data values are quantitative and the number of values is finite. Continuous or numerical data result from infinitely many possible quantitative values, where the collection of values is not countable. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of countable data plays a key role in the preceding definitions, but it is not a particularly easy concept to understand. Continuous data can be measured, but not counted. If you select a particular value from continuous data, there is no next data value.  </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Levels of Measurement</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another common way of classifying data is to use four levels of measurement; nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. When we are applying statistics to real problems, the level of measurement of the data helps us to decide which procedure to use. Don’t do computations and don’t use statistical methods that are not appropriate for the data. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Ratio</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a natural zero starting point and ratios make sense. These are heights, lengths, distances, and volumes.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Interval</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Differences are meaningful, but there is no natural zero starting point and ratios are meaningless. Body temperatures in degrees is an example.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Ordinal</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data can be arranged in order, but differences either can’t be found or are meaningless. Examples are ranks of colleges.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Nominal</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Categories only. Data cannot be arranged in order. An example is eye colors.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nominal level of measurement is characterized by data that consist of names, labels, or categories only. The data cannot be arranged in some order. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because nominal data lack any ordering or numerical significance, they should not be used for calculations. Numbers such as 1,2,3, or 4 are sometimes assigned to the different categories, but these numbers have no real computational significance and any average calculated from them is meaningless and possibly misleading.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data are at the ordinal level of measurement if they can be arranged in some order, but differences between data values cannot be determined or are meaningless.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ordinal data provide information about relative comparisons, but not the magnitudes of the differences. Usually, ordinal data should not be used for calculations such as an average, but this guideline is sometimes ignored.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data are at the interval level of measurement if they can be arranged in order, and differences between data values  can be found and are meaningful. Data at this level do not have a natural zero starting point at which none of the quantity is present. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data are at the ratio level of measurement if they can be arranged in order, differences can be found and are meaningful, and there is a natural zero starting point. For data at this level, differences and ratios are both meaningful.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The distinction between the interval and ratio levels of measurement can be a bit tricky. For the ratio test, focus on the term ratio and know that the term twice describes the ratio of one value to be double the other value. To distinguish between the interval and ratio levels of measurement, use a ratio test by asking this question: Does use of the term twice make sense? Twice makes sense for data at this level of measurement, but it does not make sense for data at the interval level of measurement.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the true zero test, and for ratios to make sense, there must be a value of true zero, where the value of zero indicates that none of the quantity is present, and zero is not simply an arbitrary value on a scale. The temperature of 0 F is arbitrary and does not indicate that there is no heat, so temperatures on the Fahrenheit scale are at the interval level of measurement not the ratio level.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data refers to data sets so large and so complex that their analysis is beyond the capabilities of traditional software tools. Analysis of big data may require software simultaneously running in parallel on many different computers.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data science involves applications of statistics, computer science, and software engineering, along with some other relevant fields such as sociology or finance.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Example of Data Set Magnitudes</strong></span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terabytes </span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petabytes</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exabytes</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zettabytes</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yottabytes</span></li></ul><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Statistics in Data Science</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The modern data scientist has a solid background in statistics and computer systems as well as expertise in fields that extend beyond statistics. The modern data scientist might be skilled with Hadoop software, which uses parallel processing on many computers for the analysis of big data. The modern data scientist might also have a strong background in some other field such as psychology, biology, medicine, chemistry, or economics.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Missing Data</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When collecting sample data, it is quite common to find that some values are missing. Ignoring missing data can sometimes create misleading results. If you make the mistake of skipping over a few different samples when you are manually typing them into a statistics software program, the missing values are not likely to have a serious effect on the results. However, if a survey includes many missing salary entries because those with very low incomes are reluctant to reveal their salaries, those missing values will have the serious effect of making salaries appear higher than they really are.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A data value is missing completely at random if the likelihood of its being missing is independent of its value or any of the other values in the data set. That is, any data value is just as likely to be missing as any other data value. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A data value is missing not at random if the missing value is related to the reason that it is missing.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missing data at random can happen and an example is when using a keyboard to manually enter ages of survey respondents and makes the mistake of failing to enter the age of 37 years. The data value is missing completely at random.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Biased Results</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the two definitions and examples from the previous page, it makes sense to conclude that if we ignore data missing completely at random, the remaining values are not likely to be biased and good results should be obtained. However, if we ignore data that are missing, not at random, it is very possible that the remaining values are biased and results will be misleading.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Correcting for Missing Data</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are different methods for dealing with missing data. One very common method for dealing with missing data is to delete all subjects having any missing values. If the data are missing completely at random, the remaining values are not likely to be biased and good results can be obtained, but with a smaller sample size. If the data are missing not at random, deleting subjects having any missing values can easily result in a bias among the remaining values, so results can be misleading. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can also input missing data values when we substitute values for them. There are different methods of determining the replacement values, such as using the mean of the other values, or using a randomly selected value from other similar cases, or using a method based on regression analysis. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When analyzing sample data with missing values, try to determine why they are missing, then decide whether it makes sense to treat the remaining values as being representative of the population. If it appears that there are missing values that are missing not at random, know that the remaining data may well be biased and any conclusions based on those remaining values may well be misleading.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an experiment, we apply some treatment and then proceed to observe its effects on the individuals. The individuals in experiments are called experimental units and they are often called subjects when they are people. In an observational study, we observe and measure specific characteristics, but we don’t attempt to modify the individuals being studied. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experiments are often better than observational studies because well planned experiments typically reduce the chance of having the results affected by some variable that is not part of the study. A lurking variable is one that affects the variables included in the study, but it is not included in the study.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Design of Experiments</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good design of experiments includes replication, blinding, and randomization.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replication is the repetition of an experiment on more than one individual. Good use of replication requires sample sizes that are large enough so that we can see effects of treatments. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blinding is used when the subject doesn’t know whether he or she is receiving a treatment or a placebo. Blinding is a way to get around the placebo effect, which occurs when an untreated subject reports an improvement in symptoms. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Randomization is used when individuals are assigned to different groups through a process of random selection. The logic behind randomization is to use chance as a way to create two groups that are similar. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A simple random sample of n subjects is selected in such a way that every possible sample of the same size n has the same chance of being chosen.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike careless or haphazard sampling, random sampling usually requires very careful planning and execution. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Simple Random Sample</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sample of n subjects is selected so that every sample of the same size n has the same chance of being selected</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Systematic Sample</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Select every kth subject</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Convenience Sample</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use data that are very easy to get</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Stratified Sample</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subdivide populations into strata or groups with the same characteristics, then randomly sample within those strata.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Cluster Sample</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partition the population in clusters or groups, then randomly select all members of the selected clusters.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Multistage Sampling</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional pollsters and government researchers often collect data by using some combination of the preceding sampling methods. In a multistage sample design, pollsters select a sample in different stages, and each stage might use different methods of sampling.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a cross sectional study, data are observed, measured, and collected at one point in time, not over a period of time.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a retrospective study, data are collected from a past timer period by going back in time.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a prospective study, data are collected in the future from groups that share common factors.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Experiments</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an experiment, confounding occurs when we can see some effect, but we can’t identify the specific factor that caused it.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A randomized block design uses the same basic idea as stratified sampling, but randomized block designs are used when designing experiments, whereas stratified sampling is used for surveys.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Matched Pairs Design</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compare two treatment groups by using subjects matched in pairs that are somehow related ort have similar characteristics. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Rigorously Controlled Design</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carefully assign subjects to different treatment groups, so that those given each treatment are similar in the ways that are important to the experiment. This can be extremely difficult to implement, and often we can never be sure that we have accounted for all of the relevant factors. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Sampling Errors</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In statistics, you could use a good sampling method and do everything correctly, and yet it is possible to get wrong results. No matter how well you plan and execute the sample collection process, there is likely to be some error in the results.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sampling error occurs when the sample has been selected with a random method, but there is a discrepancy between a sample result and the true population result, such an error results from chance sample fluctuations.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A non sampling error is the result of human error, including such factors as wrong data entries, computing errors, questions with biased wording, false data provided by respondents, forming biased conclusions, or applying statistical methods that are not appropriate for the circumstances. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A non random sampling error is the result of using a sampling method that is not random, such as using a convenience sample or a voluntary response sample.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>The Gold Standard</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Randomization with placebo/treatment groups is sometimes called the gold standard because it is so effective.</span></p><p> </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1h94pmtcia" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>What Statistics Is All About</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first considerations is designing appropriate studies. The purpose is to collect data. This process can be done with either surveys or experiments. One of the most popular ways to collect data is the observational study in a way that does not affect them. Surveys have to be worded carefully to get good information.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An experiment is another popular way to gather data. It involves treatments on participants so that clear comparisons can be made. After treatments are made, responses are recorded. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collecting quality data is a major consideration. It really does no good to get bad data. So, studies and experiments must be planned well. Once you have good data, you can make a good report on what you found. To minimize bias in a survey, you have to be random when selecting participants. </span></p><p><br><br></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Descriptive Statistics</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are numerical values that describe a data set. This is usually done through different types of categories. If the data are categorical they are usually summarized using the number of individuals in each group. This is called the frequency. If you use the percentage of individuals, it is called the relative frequency.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerical data represent measurements or counts. You can do more with numerical data. For example, you can get the measure of center and the measure of spread in the data. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some descriptive statistics are more appropriate than others in certain situations. The average is not always the best measure of the center of a data set. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Charts and Graphs</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data is summarized in a visual way using charts and graphs. These are displays that are organized to give you a big picture of the data. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the basic graphs used for categorical data include pie charts and bar graphs. These break down variables in the data. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For numerical data, a different type of graph is needed. Histograms and box plots are usually used to represent numerical data. These types of graphs make it easier to visualize the data.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Distributions</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A variable is a characteristic that is being counted or measured. A distribution is a listing of the possible values of a variable and how often they occur. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different types of distributions exist for different types of variables.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a variable is counting the number of successes in a certain number of trials, it has a binomial distribution. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the variable takes on values that occur according to a bell-shaped curve, then that variable has a normal distribution.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the variable is based on sample averages and you have limited data, the t-distribution may be in order.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to distributions, you need to know how to decide which distribution a particular variable has, how to find probabilities for it, and how to figure out what the long-term average and standard deviation of the outcomes would be.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Performing Analyses</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After data has been collected and described, it is time to do the statistical analysis. There are many types of analyses. You have to choose the appropriate type for your data. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You often see statistics that try to estimate numbers pertaining to an entire population. However, it is just an estimate and most studies only ask a small number of people their questions. What happens is that data is collected on a small sample of people. Sometimes the results they get are very inaccurate. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sample results vary from sample to sample, and this amount of variability needs to be reported but usually it is not. The statistic used to measure and report the level of precision in someone’s sample result is called the margin of error. The range of the margin of error is called the confidence interval. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Hypothesis Tests</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One major staple of research studies is called hypothesis testing. A hypothesis test is a technique for using data to validate or invalidate a claim about a population. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elements about a population that are most often tested are:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The population mean</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The population proportion</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference in two population means or proportions</span></li></ul><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hypothesis tests are used in a host of areas that affect your everyday life, such as medical studies, advertisements, and polling data. Often you only hear the conclusions of hypothesis tests but you don’t see the methods used to come to these conclusions. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Drawing Conclusions</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To perform statistical analyses, researchers use software that depends on formulas. You have to use them correctly, though. Some of the most common mistakes made in conclusions are overstating the results. Until you do a controlled experiment, you can’t make a cause-and-effect conclusion based on relationships you find. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statistics is about much more than numbers. You need to understand how to make appropriate conclusions from studying data and be smart enough to not believe everything you read. </span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1h9j7v829l" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Working with Tables and Graphs</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When working with large data sets, a frequency distribution is often helpful in organizing and summarizing data. A frequency distribution helps us to understand the nature of the distribution of a data set.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Frequency Distribution</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A frequency distribution or table shows how data are partitioned among several categories by listing the categories along with the number of data values in each of them.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower class limits are the smallest numbers that can belong to each of the different classes. Upper class limits are the largest numbers that can belong to each of the different classes. Class boundaries are the numbers used to separate the classes, but without the gaps created by class limits. Class midpoints are the values in the middle of the classes. Class width is the difference between two consecutive lower class limits in a frequency distribution.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding the correct class width can be tricky. For class width, don’t make the most common mistake of using the difference between a lower class limit and an upper class limit. For class boundaries, remember that they split the difference between the end of one class and the beginning of the next class.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We construct frequency distributions to:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summarize large data sets</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">See the distribution and identify outliers</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a basis for constructing graphs</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology can generate frequency distributions but these are the common steps:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Select the number of classes, usually between 5 and 20</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calculate class width: \(\frac{\text{max data value - min data value}}{\text{number of classes}} \)</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Round this result to get a convenient number</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose the value for the first lower class limit by using either the min value or a convenient value below the minimum.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the first lower class limit and the class width, list the other lower class limits.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">List the lower class limits in a vertical column and then determine and enter the upper class limits.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take each individual data value and put a tally mark in the appropriate class. Add the tally marks to find the total frequency for each class.</span></li></ul><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Relative Frequency Distribution</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A variation of the basic frequency distribution is a relative frequency distribution. Each class frequency is replaced by a relative frequency as a percentage. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[ \text{relative frequency} = \frac{\text{frequency for class}}{\text{sum of frequencies}} * 100 \]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will give you the frequency percentage.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sum of the percentages in a relative frequency distribution will be very close to 100 percent.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another variation of a frequency distribution is a cumulative frequency distribution in which the frequency for each class is the sum of the frequencies for that class and all previous classes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the beginning we noted that a frequency distribution can help us understand the distribution of a data set, which is the nature or shape of the spread of the data over the range of values. In statistics, we are often interested in determining whether the data have a normal distribution. Data that have an approximately normal distribution are characterized by a frequency distribution with the following features:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The frequencies start low, then increase to one or two high frequencies, and then decrease to a low frequency.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The distribution is approximately symmetric. Frequencies preceding the maximum frequency should be roughly a mirror image of those that follow the maximum frequency.</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The presence of gaps can suggest that the data are from two or more different populations.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comparing two or more relative frequency distributions in one table makes comparisons of data much easier.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a frequency distribution is a useful tool for summarizing data and investigating the distribution of data, an even better tool is a histogram, which is a graph that is easier to interpret than a table of numbers.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A histogram visually displays the shape of the distribution of the data. It shows the location of the center of the data. Histograms show the spread of data and can also identify outliers.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A histogram is basically a graph of a frequency distribution. Class frequencies should be used for the vertical scale and that scale should be labeled. There is no universal agreement on the procedure for selecting which values are used for the bar locations along the horizontal scale, but it is common to use class boundaries, class midpoints, class limits, or something else. It is often easier for us to use class midpoints for the horizontal scale. Histograms can usually be generated using technology.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A relative frequency histogram has the same shape and horizontal scale as a histogram, but the vertical scale uses relative frequencies instead of actual frequencies. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ultimate objective of using histograms is to be able to understand characteristics of data. Exploring the data means to:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find the center of the data</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find the variation</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find the shape of the distribution</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find any outliers</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find the change of data over time</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a graph is said to be skewed to the right, it means the histogram shape has a tail on the right.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a graph is said to be skewed to the left, it means the histogram shape has a tail on the left.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bell-shaped distribution is called a normal distribution and has its highest values in the middle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uniform distribution is a histogram with roughly the same values all the way across.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many statistical methods require that sample data come from a population having a distribution that is approximately a normal distribution.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a uniform distribution, the different possible values occur with approximately the same frequency, so the heights of the bars in the histogram are approximately uniform. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A distribution of data is skewed if it is not symmetric and extends more to one side than to the other. Data skewed to the right, called positively skewed, have a longer right tail.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data skewed to the left, called negatively skewed, have a longer left tail.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some really important methods have a requirement that sample data must be from a population having a normal distribution. Histograms can be helpful in determining whether the normality requirement is satisfied, but they are not very helpful with very small data sets.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The population distribution is normal if the pattern of the points in the normal quantile plot is reasonably close to a straight line, and the points do not show some systematic pattern that is not a straight-line pattern.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The population distribution is not normal if the normal quantile plot has either or both of these two conditions:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The points do not lie reasonably close to a straight-line pattern</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The points show some systematic pattern that is not a straight-line pattern</span></li></ol><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Graphs that Enlighten</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dot plot graph is a good type of graph. It consists of a graph of quantitative data in which each data value is plotted as a point above a horizontal scale of values. Dots representing equal values are stacked. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dot plot:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Displays the shape of the distribution of data</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is usually possible to recreate the original list of data values.</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A stem plot is another type of graph and it represents quantitative data by separating each value into two parts: the stem and the leaf. Better stem plots are often obtained by first rounding the original data values. Also, stem plots can be expanded to include more rows and can be condensed to include fewer rows.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stem plots:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shows the shape of the distribution of data</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retains the original data values</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sample data are sorted</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A time-series graph is a graph of time-series data, which are quantitative data that have been collected at different points in time, such as monthly or yearly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time-series graphs:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reveals information about trends over time</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bar graphs use bars of equal width to show frequencies of categories of categorical data. The bars may or not be separated by small gaps.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bar graphs:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shows the relative distribution of categorical data so that it is easier to compare the different categories.</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A pareto chart is a bar graph for categorical data, with the added stipulation that the bars are arranged in descending order according to frequencies, so the bars decrease in height from left to right. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pareto charts:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shows the relative distribution of categorical data so that it is easier to compare the different categories.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Draws attention to the more important categories.</span></li></ol><p><br><br></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A pie chart is a very common graph that depicts categorical data as slices of a circle, in which the size of each slice is proportional to the frequency count for the category. Although pie charts are very common, they are not as effective as Pareto charts.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pie charts:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shows the distribution of categorical data in a commonly used format.</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to never use pie charts because they waste ink on components that are not data, and they lack an appropriate scale.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A frequency polygon uses line segments connected to points located directly above class midpoint values. A frequency polygon is very similar to a histogram, but a frequency polygon uses line segments instead of bars. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A variation of the basic frequency polygon is the relative frequency polygon, which uses relative frequencies for the vertical scale. An advantage of relative frequency polygons is that two or more of them can be combined on a single graph for easy comparison. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Graphs that Deceive</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deceptive graphs are commonly used to mislead people. Graphs should be constructed in a way that is fair and objective. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A common deceptive graph involves using a vertical scale at some value greater than zero to exaggerate differences between groups. This is called a nonzero vertical graph. Always examine a graph carefully to see whether a vertical axis begins at some point other than zero so that differences are exaggerated.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pictographs are another type of chart that are used to mislead. Data that are one-dimensional in nature are often depicted with two-dimensional objects or three-dimensional objects. By using pictographs, artists can create false impressions that grossly distort differences by using these same principles of basic geometry:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you double each side of a square, it’s area doesn’t merely double, it increase by a factor of four</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you double each side of a cube, its volume doesn’t merely double, it increases by a factor of eight</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When examining data depicted with a pictograph, determine whether the graph is misleading because objects of area or volume are used to depict amounts that are actually one-dimensional. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For small data sets of 20 values or fewer, use a table instead of a graph. A graph of data should make us focus on the true nature of the data, not on other elements, such as eye-catching but distracting design features. Do not distort data. Construct a graph to reveal the true nature of the data. Almost all of the ink in a graph should be used for the data, not for the design elements.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A correlation exists between two variables when the values of one variable are somehow associated with the values of the other variable.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A linear correlation exists between two variables when there is a correlation and the plotted points of paired data result in a  pattern that can be approximated by a straight line. A scatterplot is a plot of paired quantitative data with a horizontal x-axis and the vertical axis is used for the second variable y. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The presence of correlation between two variables is not evidence that one of the variables causes the other. We might find a correlation between beer consumption and weight, but we cannot conclude from the statistical evidence that drinking beer has a direct effect on weight. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A scatterplot can be very helpful in determining whether there is a correlation between the two variables.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The linear correlation coefficient is denoted by r, and it measures the strength of the linear association between two variables. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we do not conclude that there appears to be a linear correlation between two variables, we can find the equation of the straight line that best fits the sample data, and that equation can be used to predict the value of one variable when given a specific value of the other variable. Instead of using the straight-line equation of \(y = mx + b \) that we have all learned in prior math courses, we use the format that follows.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given a collection of paired sample data, the regression line, or line of best fit, is the straight line that best fits the scatter plot of the data. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identify the lower class limits, upper class limits, class width, class midpoints, and class boundaries for the given frequency distribution. Also identify the number of individuals in the summary.</span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1heh9r1g812" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Measures of Center</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measures of center are widely used to provide representative values that summarize data sets.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A measure of center is a value at the center or middle of a data set. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mean is generally the most important of all numerical measurements used to describe data. It is what most people call an average.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mean of a set of data is the measure of center found by adding all of the data values and dividing the total by the number of data values.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sample means drawn from the same population tend to vary less than other measures of center. The mean of a data set uses every data value. A disadvantage of the mean is that just one extreme value can change the value of the mean substantially. This extreme value is called an outlier. By this definition, we say the mean is not resistant.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A statistic is resistant if the presence of extreme values does not cause it to change very much. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The definition of the mean can be expressed by the formula:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[\frac{\sigma x}{n} \]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sigma refers to the sum of values. X is the sum of all values. N is the number of values.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the data are from a sample of the population, the mean is denoted by x-bar.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the data are from the entire population, the mean is denoted by mu.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sample statistics are usually represented by English letters and population parameters are usually represented by Greek letters.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(\sigma\) denotes the sum of a set of data values.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(x\) is the variable usually used to represent the individual data values.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(n\) represents the number of data values in a sample.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(N\) represents the number of data values in a population.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never use the term average when referring to a measure of center. The word average is often used for the mean but it should not be.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The median can be thought of as a middle value. More precisely, the median of a data set is the measure of center that is the middle value when the original data values are arranged in order of increasing or decreasing magnitude. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The median does not change by large amounts when we include just a few extreme values, so the median is a resistant measure of center. The median does not directly use every data value.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The median of a sample is sometimes denoted by x-tilde or m or Med. to find the median, first sort the values. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the number of data values is odd, the median is the number located in the exact middle of the sorted list.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the number of data values is even, the median is found by computing the mean of the two middle numbers in the sorted list. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mode isn’t used much with quantitative data, but it is the only measure of center that can be used with qualitative data. The mode of a data set is the value that occurs with the greatest frequency. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mode can be found with qualitative data. A data set can have no mode or one mode or multiple modes. When two data values occur with the same greatest frequency, each one is a mode and the data set is set to be bimodal. When more than two data values occur with the same greatest frequency, each is a mode and the data set is said to be multimodal. When no data value is repeated, we say there is no mode.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Midrange is another measure of center. The midrange of a data set is the measure of center that is the value midway between the max and min values in the original data set. It is found by adding the max data value to the min data value and then dividing the sum by 2.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the midrange uses only the max and min values, it is very sensitive to those extremes so the midrange is not resistant. In practice, the midrange is rarely used, but it has 3 redeeming features:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is very easy to compute</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It helps reinforce the very important point that there are several different ways to define the center of a data set.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The value of the midrange is sometimes used incorrectly for the median, so confusion can be reduced by clearly defining the midrange along with the median. </span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When calculating measures of center, we often need to round the result.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the mean, median, and midrange, carry one more decimal than is present in the original set of values.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the mode, leave the value as is without rounding.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When applying any rounding rules, round only the final result, not anything before that.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can always calculate measures of center from a sample of numbers, but we should always think about whether it makes sense to do that. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, it makes no sense to do numerical calculations with data at the nominal level of measurement. We should also think about the sampling method used to collect data. If the sampling method is not sound, the statistics we obtain may be very misleading. </span></p><p> </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1heh9r1g813" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Measures of Variation</strong></span></h2><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Range</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To understand variation, we begin by introducing the range. The range of a set of data values is the difference between the max data value and the min data value. The range uses only the maximum and the minimum data values, so it is very sensitive to extreme values. It is not resistant. Because the range uses only the max and min values, it does not take every value into account and therefore does not truly reflect the variation among all of the data values.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[ \text{Range = max value - min value} \]</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Range Rule of Thumb</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The range rule of thumb is a quick way to ballpark the standard deviation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">25%  *  range of data</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Standard Deviation of a Sample</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The standard deviation is the measure of variation most commonly used in statistics. It is a measure of how much data values deviate away from the mean. The standard deviation found from sample data is a statistic denoted by \{\text{s}\}. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The symbol for sample standard variation is \(s\).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The symbol for population standard deviation is \(\sigma\)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The symbol for sample variance is \(s^2\)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The symbol for population variance is \(\sigma^{2}\)</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The standard deviation is a measure of how much data values deviate from the mean. The value of the standard deviation is never negative. It is zero only when all of the data values are exactly the same. Larger values indicate greater amounts of variation. The standard deviation can increase dramatically with one or more outliers. The units of the standard deviation are the same as the units of the original data values.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the steps to finding standard deviation:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find the mean of your data values</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subtract the mean from each individual sample value</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Square each of the deviations obtained from the previous step</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add all of the squares obtained from previous step</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Divide the total from previous step by n-1, which is 1 less than the total number of data values present</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find the square root of the result of the previous step.</span></li></ol><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Standard Deviation of a Population</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A different formula is used to find the standard deviation of a population. We use the value of N instead of n-1. When using a calculator, make sure which kind of deviation it is giving you. The variance of a set of values is a measure of variation equal to the square of the standard deviation. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The units of the variance are the squares of the units of the original data values. The value of the variance can increase dramatically with the inclusion of outliers. So, the variance is not resistant. The value of the variance is never negative. It is zero only when all of the data values are the same number. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In measuring variation in a set of sample data, it makes sense to begin with the individual amounts by which values deviate from the mean. It makes sense to combine those deviations into one number that can serve as a measure of variation. We do not want to add the variations because that will give us a zero answer. Instead, we want to use the absolute values of the deviations. When we find the mean of that sum, we get the mean absolute deviation, which is the mean distance of the data from the mean.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Computation of the mean absolute deviation uses absolute values, so it uses an operation that is not algebraic. The use of absolute values would be simple but it would create algebraic difficulties in inferential statistics. The standard deviation has the advantage of using only algebraic operations. Because it is based on the square root of a sum of squares, the standard deviation closely parallels distance formulas found in algebra. There are many instances where a statistical procedure is based on a similar sum of squares. Consequently, instead of using absolute values, we square all deviations so that they are nonnegative and those squares are used to calculate the standard deviation. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After finding all of the individual values we combine them by finding their sum. We then divide by n-1 because there are only n-1 values that can be assigned without constraint. With a given mean, we can use any numbers for the first n-1 values, but the last value will then be automatically determined. With division by n-1, sample variances tend to center around the value of the population variance. With division by n, sample variances tend to underestimate the value of the population variance.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A concept helpful in interpreting the value of the standard deviation is the empirical rule. This rule states that for data sets having a distribution that is approximately bell-shaped, the following properties apply:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">68 percent of all values fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">95 percent of all values fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">99.7 percent of all values fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another concept helpful in understanding a value of a standard deviation is Chebyshev’s theorem. The empirical rule applies only to data sets with bell-shaped distributions, but Chebyshev’s theorem applies to any data set. Unfortunately, results are only approximate. Because the results are lower limits, this theorem has limited usefulness. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the population mean is \(\mu\) and the population standard deviation is \(\sigma\), then the range rule of thumb for identifying significant values is as follows:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Significantly low values are \(\mu - 2\sigma\) or lower</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Significantly high values are \(\mu + 2\sigma\) or higher.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insignificant values are between the previous two values.</span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1heonrqvk40" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Measures Of Relative Standing</strong></span></h2><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measures of relative standing are numbers showing the location of data values relative to the other values within the same data set.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A z score is found by converting a value to a standardized scale. This definition shows that a z score is the number of standard deviations that a data value is away from the mean.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The z score is calculated by using:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[z = \frac{x - \Xbar}{s}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}\]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A z score is the number of standard deviations that a given value is above or below the mean.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Z scores are expressed as numbers with no units of measurement.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A data value is significantly low if its z score is less than or equal to -2 or the value is significantly high if its z score is greater than or equal to +2.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an individual data value is less than the mean, its corresponding z score is a negative number.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A value is significantly low or significantly high if it is at least two standard deviations away from the mean. It follows that significantly low values have z scores less than or equal to -2 and significantly high values have z scores greater than or equal to +2. If a value is in between these values then it is not significant.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A z score is a measure of position, in the sense that it describes the location of a value relative to the mean. Percentiles and quartiles are other measures of position useful for comparing values within the same data set or between different data sets.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Percentiles</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Percentiles are one type of quantiles or fractiles which partition data into groups with roughly the same number of values in each group.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 50th percentile has about 50% of the data values below and above it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of finding the percentile that corresponds to a particular data value is given by the following formula:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[\text{percentile} = \frac{\text{number of values less than x}}{\text{total number of values}}*100\]</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Notation</strong></span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">N = total number of values in the data set</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">K = percentile being used, for example k=25</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">L = locator that gives the position of a value.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(P_k\) = kth percentile</span></li></ul><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Algorithm</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sort the data from lowest to highest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compute \(L=\frac{k}{100}*n\) where n= number of values and k= percentile in question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is L a whole number?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If yes, the value of the kth percentile is midway between the Lth value and the next value in the sorted set of data.

This means it is not symmetric.</span></p><h2 class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Basics of Probability</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Probability plays a central role in the important statistical method of hypothesis testing. Statisticians make decisions using data by rejecting explanations based on very low probabilities.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In probability, we deal with procedures that produce outcomes. An event is any collection of results or outcomes of a procedure. A simple event is an outcome or an event that cannot be further broken down into simpler components. The sample space for a procedure consists of all possible simple events. That is, the sample space consists of all outcomes that cannot be broken down any further.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Notation for Probabilities</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">P denotes a probability</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A,B, and C denote specific events</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">P(A) denotes the probability of event A occurring</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Three Approaches to Finding the Probability</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conduct a procedure and count the number of times that event A occurs. P(A) is then approximated as follows:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relative Frequency Approximation- \(P(A) = \frac{\text{number of time A occurred}}{\text{number of times procedure repeated}}\)</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Classical Approach to probability - If a procedure has n different sample events that are equally likely, and if event A can occur in s different ways, then: \(P(A)=\frac{\text{number of ways A occurs}}{\text{number of different simple events}}=\frac{s}{n}\)</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subjective Probabilities-P(A), the probability of event A, is estimated by using knowledge of the relevant circumstances.</span></li></ol><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Simulations</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes none of the preceding three approaches can be used. A simulation of a procedure is a process that behaves in the same ways as the procedure itself so that similar results are produced. Probabilities can sometimes be found by using a simulation.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Law of Large Numbers</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a procedure is repeated again and again, the relative frequency probability of an event tends to approach the actual probability. It tells us that relative frequency approximations tend to get better with more observations. This law reflects a simple notion supported by common sense: a probability estimate based on only a few trials can be off by a substantial amount, but with a very large number of trials, the estimate tends to be much more accurate.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t make the common mistake of finding a probability value by mindlessly dividing a smaller value by a larger number. Instead, think carefully about the numbers involved and what they represent. Carefully identify the total number of items being considered. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Complementary Events</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes we need to find the probability that an event does not occur. The complement of event A, denoted by \(\Abar\), consists of all outcomes in which event A does not occur. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Identifying Significant Results</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If, under a given assumption, the probability of a particular observed event is very small and the observed event occurs significantly less than or significantly greater than what we typically expect with that assumption, we conclude that the assumption is probably not correct.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can use probabilities to identify values that are significantly low or significantly high.</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High number of successes: x successes among n trials is a significantly high number of successes if the probability of x or more successes is unlikely with a probability of 0.05 or less. </span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low number of successes: x successes among n trials is a significantly low number of successes if the probability of x or fewer successes is unlikely with a probability of 0.05 or less.</span></li></ol><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Odds</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expressions of likelihood are often given as odds, such as 50:1. Here are advantages of probabilities and odds:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Odds make it easier to deal with money transfers associated with gambling.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Probabilities make calculations easier, so they tend to be used by statisticians, mathematicians, scientists, and researchers in all fields.</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the three definitions that follow, the actual odds against and the actual odds in favor reflect the actual likelihood of an event, but the payoff odds describe the payoff amounts that are determined by gambling houses. </span></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on November 8, 2023</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/statistics/">Statistics</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fintroduction-to-statistics.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fintroduction-to-statistics.html&amp;via=Science%20By%20Jason&amp;text=Introduction%20to%20Statistics" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/logarithmic-functions-in-algebra.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Logarithmic Functions In Algebra </a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/statistics-and-problem-solving.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Statistics and Problem Solving </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-11-05T20:59" class="feed__date">November 5, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/measures-of-center-in-statistics.html" class="invert">Measures of Center In Statistics</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-09-05T12:56" class="feed__date">September 5, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/working-with-tables-and-graphs-in-statistics.html" class="invert">Working with Tables and Graphs in Statistics</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-08-30T22:13" class="feed__date">August 30, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/what-statistics-is-all-about.html" class="invert">What Statistics Is All About</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></script></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Jason Moore 2021</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
