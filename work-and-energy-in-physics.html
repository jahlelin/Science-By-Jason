Force<br>analysis works well in problems where there is a constant or where there is a<br>balance of forces. <br><br>But when the force acts over a distance, especially when that force is not<br>constant, then work-energy analysis is the correct analytic tool. To handle the<br>transformation of force over a distance, we first need to define the concepts of<br>kinetic and potential energy. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Kinetic Energy</strong></span><br>A constant force applied to a mass over a distance produces an acceleration<br>according to F=ma. This acceleration over a distance changes the velocity of the<br>mass in accord with the kinetic equation \(v^2=v^2_{o}+2a(x-x_{o})\). If an in<br>this equation is replaced with F/m, then \(v^2=v^2_{o}+2(F/m)(x-x_{o})\). If the<br>constant force over a distance is identified as the work, then:<br>\[F(x-x_{o})=W=mv^2/2-mv^2_{o}/2\]<br>This simple derivation suggests a more formal look at the work performed on a<br>mass by a force.<br><br>The work performed on a mass by a force is defined as the integral of the force<br>times the distance over a specified distance. Mathematically, this is \(\int<br>F*ds\). If the force is replaced by ma and the distance taken in one dimension,<br>then the work integral becomes:<br>\[W=\int_{x1}^{x2} madx\]<br>The acceleration can be written as a chain derivative:<br>\[a=\frac{dy}{dt}=\frac{dy}{dx}\frac{dx}{dt}\]<br>Then:<br>\[adx=\frac{dy}{dx}\frac{dx}{dt}dx=\frac{dx}{dt}dv=vdv\]<br>Which makes the integral:<br>\[W=\int_{v1}^{v2} mvdv=\frac{mv_{2}^{2}}{2}-\frac{mv_{1}^{2}}{2}\]<br><br>When a force is applied to a mass over a distance and that mass accelerates,<br>then there is a difference in velocity of the mass between before and after the<br>application of the force. The work performed is manifest in this velocity, and<br>the \(mv^2/2\) form is called the kinetic energy. Work is transformed into<br>kinetic energy. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Gravitational Potential Energy</strong></span><br>Gravitational potential energy comes from the acceleration due to gravity and<br>the accompanying force on a mass on the surface of the Earth. If a mass is<br>raised from a height\( y_{1}\), to a height \(y_{2}\), directly opposite the<br>acceleration due to gravity, then work performed appears as gravitational<br>potential energy.<br>\[W=\int F*ds=\int_{y1}^{y2} mgdy=mgy_{2}-mgy_{1}\]<br><br>This mgy term is the gravitational potential. In mechanical systems, the total<br>energy of the system is the sum of the kinetic plus potential energies. In a<br>mechanical system on the surface of the Earth, work performed on the system can<br>appear as kinetic or potential energy.<br><br>work performed = change in kinetic energy + change in potential energy<br><br>A convenient way of understanding this is to say that work goes into kinetic or<br>potential energy. <br><br>Look first at a block sliding down a frictionless inclined plane. The velocity<br>at the bottom of the plane is related to the height h from which the block fell.<br><br>The kinetic energy at the bottom of the plane is \(mv^2/2\), and this must equal<br>mgh, the potential energy at the top of the plane. The gravitational potential<br>energy goes into kinetic energy.<br>\[\frac{mv^2}{2}=mgh\]<br>If mass =3.0 kg<br>Inclined plane =4.0 m<br>Angle at bottom of inclined plane and ground is 58 degrees<br>Height =3.4 m<br>We get:<br>\[v=\sqrt{2(9.8m/s^2)3.4m}=8.2m/s\]<br>If the block were to continue to slide horizontally along a frictionless<br>surface, it would maintain this 8.2 m/s velocity.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Frictional Forces</strong></span><br>Frictional forces are proportional to the normal force(the force between two<br>surfaces) and a constant characteristic of the interface(the surfaces involved).<br>They also act to oppose the motion. Frictional forces acting over a distance<br>result in energy lost due to friction. <br><br>A coefficient of friction between the block and a flat surface at the bottom of<br>the plane would result in energy lost to friction and the block eventually<br>coming to rest. In this problem, the potential energy at the top of the incline<br>plane goes into kinetic energy at the bottom of the plane, and this energy goes<br>into work to overcome friction.<br><br>Give the flat surface a coefficient of 0.20, and the frictional retarding force<br>is:<br>\[f=\mu mg=0.20(3kg)9.8m/s^2=5.9N\]<br><br>To find the distance the block slides, we can go back to the kinetic energy at<br>the bottom of the plane or the potential energy at the top of the plane. Since<br>there are no lossed, thes enumbers must be the same. Take the potential energy<br>at the top of the plane because it is easier to calculate and is original data<br>in the problem. This energy must equal the work due to friction fl or:<br>\[mgh=fL=\mu mgL\]<br>\[3.0kg(9.8m/s^2)3.4m=100J=0.20(3kg)(9.8m/s^2)L\]<br>\[L=17m\]<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 1</strong></span><br>Place a 3 kg block at the top of a 3.4 m high frictionless incline. At the<br>bottom of the incline, the block encounters a spring with a constant of 400 N/m<br>on a horizontal surface. No energy is lost to friction. how far is the spring<br>compressed?<br><br>Solution:<br>The energy at the top of the plane, which is the same as the energy at the<br>bottom of the plane, goes into compressing the spring. The energy at the top of<br>the plane is:<br>\[100J=\frac{kx^2}{2}\]<br>\[x=\frac{200J*m}{400N}^{1/2}=0.71m\]<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 2</strong></span><br>Now complicate the first problem by adding a coefficient of friction of 0.20 for<br>the horizontal surface. How far does the block slide while compressing the<br>spring?<br><br>Solution:<br>Now the potential energy goes into compressing the spring and overcoming<br>friction. This statement is very helpful in writing the equation. In words, the<br>potential energy mgh equals the energy to compress the spring \(kx^2/2\) plus<br>the work to overcome friction \(\mu mgx\) or:<br>\[mgh=\frac{kx^2}{2}+\mu mgx\]<br>\[100J=(200N/m)x^2+0.20(3kg)(9.8m/s^2)x\]<br>\[200x^2+5.9x-100=0\]<br>\[x=\frac{-5.9 \pm \sqrt{(5.9)^2-4(200)(-100)}}{2(200)}=\frac{-5.9 \pm<br>283}{400}=0.70m\]<br>The negative root will not work for this problem, it does not make sense. The<br>block compresses the spring 0.70 m while sliding on this frictional surface.<br><br>It is instructive to do a problem first with force analysis and then with<br>work-energy analysis. Consider the case of a block sliding down an inclined<br>plane with a coefficient of friction. As will become evident, it is possible to<br>do this problem with force analysis techniques. Work-energy analysis is<br>conceptually and computationally easier.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 3</strong></span><br>Consider the inclined plane with friction. Calculate the velocity of the block<br>at the bottom of the plane using force analysis and then work-energy analysis. <br><br>Solution:<br>The unbalanced force of 20 N acts on the 5 kg block, causing it to accelerate at 4 m/s^2 down the plane. The slant height of the plane is 6m*sin35 degrees = 10.5 m.<br>This acceleration over the 10.5 m results in a velocity of:<br>\[v^2=2a(x-x_{o})=2(4m/s^2)10.5m=9.2m/s\]<br><br>Solution2:<br>Now do the same using work-energy analysis. When the block is at the top of the<br>plane, the energy is: <br>\[mgh=5kg(9.8m/s^2)(6m=294J\]<br>At the bottom of the plane, all this potential energy has gone into kinetic<br>energy(velocity of the block) except for the amount used to do work against the<br>frictional force. The work(against the frictional force) is:<br>\[\mu NL=0.20(40N)10.5=84J\]<br>The energy left after the block has slid down the plane is the 294 J at the top<br>of the plane minus the 84 J lost to friction, and this energy(210J) is manifest<br>in the velocity of the block(kinetic energy). This energy is equal to the<br>\(mv^2/2\), the kinetic energy of the block at the bottom of the plane.<br>\[\frac{(5kg)v^2}{2}=210J=9.2m/s\]<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 4</strong></span><br>A 3 kg block sliding at 12 m/s along a frictionless surface encounters a spring<br>with a force constant of 500 N/m resting on a surface with a coefficient of<br>friction of 0.25. The friction surface is only under the spring. What is the<br>maximum compression of the spring?<br><br>Solution:<br>When the block encounters the spring and the friction surface, all the energy is<br>kinetic, \(mv^2/2\). This energy goes into compressing the spring and sliding<br>along the friction surface. The equation looks like this:<br>\[\frac{mv^2}{2}+\frac{kx^2}{2}+\mu mgx\]<br><br>be careful in writing this statement. Many people write the kinetic energy<br>correctly, the energy to compress the spring correctly, and then write the force<br>to slide along the friction surface. Be aware of this mistake, and check the<br>units to be sure that the units on one side of the equation are the same as the<br>units on the other side of the equation.<br><br>You may have noticed that in all the problems the first equation is written with<br>units just as a reminder that checking units will reduce the number of errors.<br>It is very frustrating to make a simple mistake that could have been avoided had<br>units been checked in the problem before proceeding with the numerical<br>calculations.<br>\[\frac{3kg(12m/s)^2}{2}=\frac{500N}{m}\frac{x^2}{2}+0.25(3kg)(9.8m/s^2)x\]<br>The units are correct, so without units the equation is:<br>\[250x^2+7.35x-216=0\]<br>\[x=\frac{-7.35 \pm \sqrt{7.35^2-4(250)(-216)}}{2*250}=\frac{-7.4 \pm<br>464.8}{500}=0.91m\]<br>This is the amount the spring is compressed as the block comes to a stop.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 5</strong></span><br>For the situation described previously, find the velocity with which the block<br>leaves the spring.<br><br>Solution:<br>Start this problem with the spring compresses the 0.91 m. At this point the<br>potential energy stored in the spring is used to push the block 0.91 m back<br>across the friction surface. The energy remaining as the block leaves the spring<br>is the original kinetic energy less the energy expended in two 0.91 trips across<br>this friction surface. In word equation form, this is:<br>\[KE_{initial}-2(\mu mgx's)=KE_{final}\]<br>The total work performed in the block moving across the surface is:<br>\[2[0.25(3kg)(9.8m/s^2)0.91m]=13.4J\]<br>The velocity of the block as it flies off the spring is:<br>\[\frac{3kg(144m/s^2)}{2}-13.4J=\frac{(3.0kg)v^2_{f}}{2}=v_{f}=11.6m/s\]<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 6</strong></span><br>Go back to an inclined plane problem but with the addition of a spring with a<br>force constant of 300 N/m placed at the bottom of the incline. Calculate the<br>compression of the spring when the block slides down the plane.<br><br>Solution:<br>An approximate answer can be obtained by setting mgh, where h is the vertical<br>distance from the block to the spring, equal to \(kx^2/2\), then compresison of<br>the spring then becomes:<br>\[2.5kg(9.8m/s^2)4m=\frac{300N}{m}\frac{x^2}{2} \rightarrow x=0.81m\]<br><br>The compression of the spring gives the block a little more potential energy, so<br>a more correct statement would take into account the additional height h.<br>\[mgh+(mgx)\sin40=\frac{kx^2}{2}\]<br>\[h'=x(\sin40)\]<br>\[2.5kg(9.8m/s^2)4m+2.5kg(9.8m/s^2)x(\sin40)=\frac{300N}{m}\frac{x^2}{2}\]<br>Eliminating the units and cleaning up the numbers yields a quadratic.<br>\[150x^2-15.7x-98=0\]<br>\[x=\frac{15.7 \pm \sqrt{15.7^2-4(150)(-98)}}{2(150)}=\frac{15.7 \pm 243}{300}<br>=0.86m\]<br>This value is larger than what was calculated earlier due to the additional<br>height.<br><br>The procedure of finding an approximate solution and then refining it to the<br>exact solution is very helpful. First, you get an approximate solution that is<br>close to the exact one, and second, you educate yourself as to how to proceed to<br>the exact solution. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 7</strong></span><br>Place a mass on a track made up of a flat section L with coefficient of friction<br>\(\mu\) and two frictionless semicircular surfaces of radius R. Let the mass<br>start from the top of one of the semicircles and calculate where it comes to<br>rest.<br><br>Solution:<br>The initial potential energy is mgR. When the mass encounters the friction<br>surface, this potential energy is dissipated in doing work to overcome friction.<br>Assuming that the energy lost due to friction in one traverse is less than the<br>initial potential energy, the mass will rise to a height(on the opposite<br>semicircle) R' dictated by the energy statement:<br>\[mgR'=mgR-\mu mgL\]<br>After another traverse of the flat portion of the track, the height will be<br>dictated by:<br>\[mgR''=mgR-2 \mu gL\]<br>and so on until all the original potential energy is dissipated.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 8</strong></span><br>For the track in the previous example, take \(\mu =0.10\), R=1, and L=2m, and<br>find where the mass stops.<br><br>Solution:<br>The only way the mass loses energy is by sliding along the flat friction part of<br>the track. The initial potential energy goes into frictional work.<br>\[(mg)1.0m=0.10(mgx) \rightarrow x=10m\]<br>The mass crosses the friction area five times and ends up at the edge of the<br>friction surface opposite from where it started.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 9</strong></span><br>Consider a 10g bullet passing through a 3kg block resting on a table. The<br>velocity of the bullet is 400 m/s on entering the block and 250 m/s on exit.<br>Calculate the energy lost by the bullet in passing through the block.<br><br>Solution:<br>The energy is all kinetic, so calculating before and after gives;<br>\[KE_{i}=(1/2)(10*10^{-3}kg)(400m/s^2)=800J\]<br>\[KE_{f}=(1/2)(10*10^{-3}kg)(250m/s^2)=312J\]<br>The kinetic energy lost = 488J<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 10</strong></span><br>If 30 percent of the energy lost in the previous example is available to move<br>the block along a surface with a coefficient of friction of 0.80, how far will<br>it move?<br><br>Solution:<br>Equate the energy available to the work performed.<br>\[0.30\Delta KE=\mu mgL\]<br>\[0.30(488J)=0.80(3kg)(9.8m/s^2)L \rightarrow L=6.2m\]<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Example 11</strong></span><br>Consider an elevator weighing 4000 N held 5 m above a spring with a force<br>constant of 8000 N/m. The elevator falls onto the spring while subject to a<br>frictional retarding force(brake) of 1000 N. Describe the motion of the<br>elevator.<br><br>Solution:<br>The potential energy of the elevator with respect to the top of the spring is:<br>\[mgh=4000N(5m)=20000J\]<br>When the elevator falls, this energy, less the energy lost due to the frictional<br>brake, is available to compress the spring.<br>\[20000J-1000N(5m)=15000J=energy-to-compress-spring\]<br>The friction brake stays on while the elevator is in contact with the spring, so<br>this energy goes into \(kx^2/2\). In equation form, this is:<br>\[15000J=k(x^2/2)+fx\]<br><br>This expression is only approximately correct because if the spring is<br>compressed a distance x, then this mgx provides an additional amount of<br>potential energy. The correct equation that determines the compression of the<br>spring is:<br>\[mg(h+x)=kx^2/2+f(h+x)\]<br>Putting numbers into the equation:<br>\[(4000N/m)x^2+(1000N-4000N)x+(1000N-4000N)5m=0\]<br>The units are correct so \(4000x^2-3000x-15000=0\)<br>\[4x^2-3x-15=0\]<br>\[x=\frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9-4(4)(-15)}}{2(4)}=2.3m\]<br>The energy stored in the spring at this compressed point is:<br>\[kx^2/2=8000N/m\frac{2.3m^2}{2}=22040J\]<br><br>This amount of energy will raise the elevator and do work against friction<br>according to the equation:<br>\[22040J=mgx'+fx'\]<br>\[22040J=(5000N)x'\]<br>\[x'=4.4m\]<br>This places the elevator 2.1 m above the spring.<br><br>This analysis can be repeated until the elevator comes to a stop.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 9, 2024</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/physics/">Physics</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fwork-and-energy-in-physics.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsciencebyjason.com%2Fwork-and-energy-in-physics.html&amp;via=Science%20By%20Jason&amp;text=Work%20and%20Energy%20in%20Physics" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/parabola-equations-in-algebra.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Parabola Equations in Algebra</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/ellipses-in-algebra.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Ellipses in Algebra </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-07-26T19:36" class="feed__date">July 26, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/forces-in-physics.html" class="invert">Forces In Physics</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-07-10T18:03" class="feed__date">July 10, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/projectile-motion-in-physics.html" class="invert">Projectile Motion In Physics</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-05-13T18:47" class="feed__date">May 13, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://sciencebyjason.com/falling-body-problems-in-physics.html" class="invert">Falling Body Problems in Physics</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=3560393f-e2b2-4e8a-b593-084a41a141e6"></script></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Jason Moore 2021</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://sciencebyjason.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
